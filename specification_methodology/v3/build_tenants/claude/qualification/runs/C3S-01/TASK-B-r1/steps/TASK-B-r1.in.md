BLOCKS: METHOD, TASK
# C3S Card

After this card you receive two blocks. The block labelled METHOD is one
reference frame. The block labelled TASK is the work to do.

The METHOD block is your only method source. Apply it to the TASK and use
no knowledge of any methodology from outside it. Where the TASK needs
something the METHOD block does not supply, say so in the place the TASK
names for that. Where the TASK does not state a fact you need, say it is
missing; do not invent it.

Do what the TASK block instructs and return only what it asks for, in the
order and shape it names. For each result you give, state the predicate it
is for and its core value, in the METHOD block's own terms. Keep explicit
what the stated facts leave uncertain and where your authority ends.

There is no one to ask; do not ask questions.

===== METHOD =====
# Reference frame rf-task-b

Task: Produce the coverage ledger for a declared coverage tuple with one row and one status per evaluation, apply the diagnostic order to an observed signal, and name one revision action with the activations, results and coverage claims it reopens.

Purpose: The owning sections for workspace coverage and its statuses, frame-set declaration and selection, frames in conjunction, discovery and revision, the reuse of closed results, and the core result algebra with its conjunction.

Each excerpt below is a verbatim copy of one owning section of a member
of this method. The `Source:` line before it names the member and the
section's anchor, and gives the SHA-256 of the whole owning member. The
owning section decides; this frame owns no determination. Links inside
an excerpt are relative to the owning member's directory.

## 2. Ontology

| Term | Definition | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| Subject | the thing a claim, representation or transformation is about; exact, with inventory and bytes or semantic addresses | P3 |
| Representation | bytes, text, a model or a program standing for a subject; equal representations do not establish equal meaning | P1 |
| Interpretation | a declared contract from representation to meaning within a context; says which distinctions a consumer may rely on and which are residual | P1 |
| Context | the declared scope under which an interpretation holds: subject, definitions, basis, admissible observations | P1 |
| Outcome U | a selected, owner-defined, directly verifiable state with an acceptance interval; adequacy of a transformation is judged against it | P2 |
| Object O | a subject with scoped identity (authority, kind, value), a boundary, current state and declared material relations; identity survives admissible state and encoding change | P3 |
| Actor | whoever performs a step within a declared capability envelope (context, attention, time, capability); a role is a relation an actor occupies, not a kind of actor, and which roles exist is set by a configuration ([ACTIVATION §1 Configuration](ACTIVATION.md#configuration)), not by this definition | P0, P6 |
| Step | one bounded unit of work: intake, selected context, grant, execution, output | P0 |
| Step-produced fact | a judgment, residual, observation or authority decision produced by a step that cannot be re-acquired from declared sources; an observation reproducible from declared sources is re-acquirable and is not one | P0, P4b |
| Claim | an assertion with subject, property, basis, witness relation and falsifier | P6 |
| Evidence | the exact observations or artifacts admitted to evaluate a claim on a basis; each carries provenance, subject identity, basis and scope; evidence becomes neither semantic truth nor decision authority by being available inside a frame | P6 |
| Judgment | a recorded evaluation over an unchanged subject, with evaluator, decision, evidence, scope and revising observation | P6 |
| Authority | an identity-bearing permission to operate or to dispose acceptance within a scope; never minted from capability, label or reachability; its kinds are defined under Authority kinds below | P6 |
| Residual | a material uncertainty, omission, loss or unproven relation that remains until an authorised disposition | P4b |
| Basis | the exact state a step, claim, result or evaluation binds: every version, identity, time, topology, authority, configuration or evidence coordinate whose change can alter it; immutable, or moving with a declared way of detecting advancement and a declared condition for reevaluation; mixed bases need an explicit composite relation | P6, P3 |
| Material | of a relation: its lawful change can change an evaluation's result, invalidate its basis, change the admissible evidence, change who may perform a material operation, or change who may decide the evaluation or a material operation; of an uncertainty or closure: likewise; materiality is evaluation-relative, so a relation material in one frame may be irrelevant in another; the relation family of ACTIVATION §2 is the material relations of a step | P2, P6 |

### Frame objects

The reference frame and the objects it binds are first-class in this
corpus. Each is defined here once; [REFERENCE_FRAME](REFERENCE_FRAME.md)
states the laws over them and [ACTIVATION](ACTIVATION.md) the step that
activates one. Provenance for this subsection and the three that follow is
`stdo://releases/v2.5.1-rc.2/standards/REFERENCE_FRAME_METHOD.md#definitions`
and its child sections.

| Term | Definition | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| Evaluation | a declared question whose admissible result family, evidence basis, decision authority and, where it performs a material action, operation authority are known; it may ask for a judgment, prediction, construction, comparison, proof, refusal, classification or action recommendation | P6, P2 |
| Evaluation family | evaluations that need the same material-relation manifold, authority basis and result algebra; similar wording does not prove that two evaluations share a family | P1, P2 |
| Workspace | the bounded body of material reasoned over or acted upon, which may include constitutional sources, domain assets, designs, implementations, tools, runtime state, evidence, historical records, external dependencies and human decisions; broader than a repository, which is one possible carrier | P3 |
| Material-relation manifold | the finite, jointly interpretable set of variables, entities, identities, states, relations, invariants, authorities, observations and exclusions an evaluation family needs; a bounded relation space whose coordinate charts may overlap; no geometric mathematics or runtime abstraction is implied | P0, P2 |
| Coordinate | the complete local position from which a value, event, decision, observation or action is interpreted: the basis, identity, lineage, input, evidence and authority information the evaluation requires; equal names, values, shapes, locations or apparent topology positions do not establish coordinate equality, which follows a declared relation | P1, P3 |
| Topology | the relation structure among the material entities, capabilities, authorities, lifecycle state spaces, adjacencies and seams visible to a frame at one basis; a frame need not hold the workspace's complete topology; a state-value change preserves the frame topology only when it preserves every such entity, relation, lifecycle, authority, capability, adjacency and seam, and a transition that changes any of them is a topology mutation that may invalidate the frame's coordinates | P3 |
| Capability envelope | the competence, context capacity, tools, access, applicable evaluation- or assurance-independence conditions and configuration required to activate a frame and perform its evaluations; the same frame may be usable by one actor and unusable by another; actor capability may justify a different frame size or activation sequence and can neither waive an invariant nor widen authority | P0, P6 |
| Reference frame | a finite specification of the attention, coordinates, authority, evidence and result relations required to perform one declared evaluation family over a stated basis; its components are the frame tuple below | P0 |
| Activated frame | one frame declaration bound to an exact evaluation, workspace subject, basis, actor and evidence-acquisition boundary; a reusable declaration is not evidence that a particular activation was correct | P3, P6 |
| Frame set | the human-declared family of frames available for a governed outcome or workspace; it may intentionally hold overlaps, alternatives, specialist frames, broad exploratory frames and separately activated assurance frames; it is not required to be a partition, tree, stack or exhaustive ontology | P6 |
| Active frame configuration | the set of frame activations and declared result relations used for one evaluation or decision; one frame, or several disjoint, overlapping or composed frames; separately activated evaluations may be disjoint or overlapping | P4a |
| Lens | a reusable family of questions applied across a frame configuration; authority, capability and reuse, temporal behaviour, transport and proof are lenses when named abstractly; a lens becomes a frame only when instantiated with a bounded evaluation, basis, material manifold, evidence, authorities, result algebra and capability envelope | P2 |
| Role, persona, abstraction, component | a role allocates responsibility or authority, and the authority comes only from an admitted grant: naming a role or a frame grants none (Authority above; Authority kinds below); a persona alters an actor's approach or salience; an abstraction hides or contracts detail; a component is a structural part of a subject; each may help construct or activate a frame and none is a reference frame by identity alone; one component may appear in several frames and one frame may cross several components | P3, P6 |

### Authority kinds

Authority takes these kinds (P6): frame-set authority, the human authority
that declares or accepts a project frame set; semantic authority, the
owner of meaning for a material relation; evaluation authority, the role
permitted to perform an evaluation; operation authority, the owner-issued
grant to construct, transform, admit, publish or mutate a material subject
where an evaluation performs such an operation; decision authority, the
role permitted to accept, reject or otherwise dispose a result; and actor
identity, the human, agent, tool or process performing the work, which is
an identity and not an authority. These may coincide in a lawful case and
never collapse by default. Declaring, selecting, activating or executing a
frame grants no semantic, operation or decision authority. A read-only
evaluation declares no operation authority; an effectful evaluation
inherits the exact operation grant from its existing owner, and the frame
does not create that grant. Human authority may act directly or through an
explicitly admitted bounded proxy where the governing identity and
authority law permits it; proxy identity and human-authority identity stay
distinct (P6, P3).

### Disjointness and independence

Three relations stay distinct (P6, P1). Frame disjointness is structural:
two frames share no material variable, coordinate, evidence or result
dependency for the declared evaluations. Evaluation independence is
procedural: separately activated evaluations neither consume nor influence
one another's unclosed working results, although they may inspect the same
subject, overlap in their manifolds and later supply closed results to one
conjunction. Assurance independence is claim-relative: the governing
assurance law states the non-authorship, evidence-acquisition,
reference-exposure, actor and configuration separation a verdict needs to
count as independent assurance (EVALUATION §3). Disjoint frames need not
be independently evaluated; independently activated evaluations need not
be disjoint; and the unqualified word "independent" establishes none of
the three.

### The frame tuple

A reference frame F is the tuple ⟨Q, B, M, C, I, A, E, X, R, J, K, D⟩
(P0): Q the evaluation family; B the workspace and topology basis; M the
material-relation manifold; C the coordinate and equality law; I the
applicable invariant set; A the authority relation; E the admissible
evidence and provenance law; X the exclusion and prohibited-assumption set;
R the closed result algebra (§4 [Results](#results), or a refinement mapped
into it); J the invalidation and rechart
condition; K the actor capability envelope; and D the optional set of
declared dependencies, overlaps, inputs and outputs involving other frames.
The tuple specifies the relation; it is not a required schema or runtime
carrier (P2). Operationally a frame is an evaluation contract that defines
the finite attention scope one evaluation family requires. A prompt, a
context packet, a symbolic program or any other representation is a
projection of an activated frame, not the frame (P1). A frame is bound
when every material coordinate above resolves to an exact source, subject,
basis, authority, evidence route, actor envelope, result relation and
invalidation condition; the binding may be expressed entirely in
source-linked prose, and representation cannot create, widen or replace it
(P3, P6).

### Product lineage objects

Software is recursive and compositional: a released product may build the
next released version of itself, a dependent product, or downstream project
artifacts. Most taxonomy drift in recursive systems comes from collapsing
the roles below into one overloaded word such as "product". Each role is an
object with its own identity (P3; provenance
`stdo://releases/v2.5.1-rc.2/standards/SPEC_METHOD.md#recursive-product-taxonomy`,
whose bounded context `urn:stdo:bounded-context:recursive-product-taxonomy`
this member owns under the selected complete basis; the concept
identities below are carried unchanged).

| Term | Definition | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| Substrate (`urn:stdo:concept:recursive-product-taxonomy:substrate`) | a lower product or runtime used to build other products | P3 |
| Development product (`urn:stdo:concept:recursive-product-taxonomy:development-product`) | the role of one exact install of a released product while that install acts as builder substrate for a source project; the role creates no new product identity and transfers no meaning or authority from the builder to the product being authored | P3, P6 |
| Source project (`urn:stdo:concept:recursive-product-taxonomy:source-project`) | the mutable workspace building the next release cut | P3 |
| Release cut (`urn:stdo:concept:recursive-product-taxonomy:release-cut`) | one immutable annotated release-candidate boundary over a published feature set | P3 |
| Product (`urn:stdo:concept:recursive-product-taxonomy:product`) | the released immutable thing resulting when that release cut is accepted | P3 |
| Install (`urn:stdo:concept:recursive-product-taxonomy:install`) | a stamped workspace instance of that released product | P3 |
| Artifact (`urn:stdo:concept:recursive-product-taxonomy:artifact`) | any published output built by a source project or by a configured installed product | P3 |
| Product definition (`urn:stdo:concept:recursive-product-taxonomy:product-definition`) | the present-tense source-project authority surface, conventionally carried by `PRODUCT.md`; it defines the current product WHAT for decomposition and is not the released product artifact | P3, P2 |

The governing rules: a mutable source workspace is not called a product;
when a released product acts as builder substrate, the exact install is
bound as a development product without confusing it with the product being
authored; an immutable release cut or installed product is not confused
with the mutable source project building the next cut; the product
definition is the surface of a source project, not the released product
artifact; products may depend on other products; installed products may
build the next version of themselves or other products. The compiler
analogy is the intended model: bootstrap source, release P0, install P0,
use P0 to build the source for P1, release P1. The taxonomy is load-bearing:
blurred, dependency and self-hosting errors compound quickly and are
expensive to unwind. SPEC_METHOD §6 applies these objects to lineage and
release.

Release objects. A release cut has three neighbours that release keeps
distinct from it and from each other (P3, P6; provenance
`stdo://releases/v2.5.1-rc.2/standards/RELEASE_METHOD.md#release-identities`).
A candidate source is the mutable source-project state constructing a
possible successor; it is non-operative for released consumers. A release
subject is the exact declared product member set or artifact that one
release cut binds, described by that cut's release-scoped claims; a
carrier that holds it does not thereby make co-located material a
member. A version-line selector is a mutable
alias naming the highest-ordinal published release cut on one version
line of one project; it is convenient discovery, not immutable identity,
and not sufficient as an exact basis ([RELEASE §1](RELEASE.md#1-context-and-position)
states which).
Equal version text does not collapse these objects. A selector or a
mutable carrier may move; a release cut never moves. RELEASE §2 realises
them, with the carriers that hold them, as refs of one release source.

### Work boundary

The method governs the boundary around a probabilistic, agentic or
delegated work unit; it does not absorb the worker's internal solution
strategy into the framework (P0, P6; provenance
`stdo://releases/v2.5.1-rc.2/standards/SPEC_METHOD.md#probabilistic-work-boundary`).
The declared boundary of such a unit is an object with six parts, which the
live specification and design should declare: the input and output contract; the
required context; the capability or role expectation; the admissible
evidence and evaluator regime; the provenance obligation; and the lawful
stop, hold, gap, continuation or completion states. The worker, tool, agent
or domain implementation owns the internal HOW inside that boundary unless
the product explicitly promotes part of that HOW into reusable declared
structure. The step of ACTIVATION §1 is this unit with its intake, context
and result algebra made exact.

### Accounts of a construction

A construction is the realisation of a selected outer contract through
steps, as P0 states it (§3). Three accounts of a construction stay
distinct (P1, P0):

- the algorithmic description: the steps;
- the informational interpretation: what the data means, given under an
  Interpretation (the ontology table above);
- the computational realisation: how people, machines or combinations of
  them carry it out in a declared execution environment; for a build
  tenant that environment is the one
  [SPEC_METHOD §11](SPEC_METHOD.md#11-build-tenant-binding) defines.

The distinction is kept for any construction and is independent of the
tiers of this corpus: a construction may need all three accounts, and no
account is a tier (P1). The distinction is an added choice in the sense
of §3 Foundation to law, not a commitment, and has none of the standings
of §1; its owner is the Intent of the Product that owns this corpus, in
its Direction. Purpose and material relation: the steps, the meaning of
the data and the means of execution can each change while the others
hold, so a claim about one account is never taken for a claim about
another (P1, P6).

### Imports between members

A member that uses a concept another member defines imports it and does
not define it again (P1, P3; provenance
`stdo://releases/v2.5.1-rc.2/standards/SPEC_METHOD.md#bounded-context-semantic-resolution`,
whose semantic import adopts the cited meaning unchanged). An import is
reference-only. Source and target meanings are identical owner-qualified
references, not new local definitions. Direction is from the named source
to the importing context; loss is none and no translation or ownership
transfer is asserted. An import provides no semantic, evaluation,
operation or decision authority (P6). A use that changes, narrows or loses
the source meaning is not an import and is never declared as one.

An import declaration states, for each imported concept (P1, P3, P6):

- what is imported: the concept, under the name its owner gives it;
- its owner: the owning section of the member that defines it, which is a
  place in the text, not a semantic authority (Authority kinds above);
- the source context: the bounded context the owning member declares, or
  that member itself where it declares none;
- the target context and the member that owns it;
- the direction and the loss, which one sentence may state for all the
  concepts of one declaration.

An import takes one of two forms. A declaration states these contents
for each imported concept in one place; between members of this corpus it
rests on the authority of the Product that owns the corpus, so the
relation is owner-authorised (P6). A reference at the point of use
that names the owning section is also an import: it states what is
imported and its owner; its source context is the one the list above
names, its target is the using member's context, and its direction, loss
and lack of authority are those stated above. A concept another member
defines enters a bounded context only by one of these forms, never by
proximity or equal spelling (P1, P3).

An activation binds each member's distinct coordinates in its selected
complete governing basis; equal cut selection does not mean equal member
coordinates. Adoption is a target's taking an imported concept into use
under the conditions its source states, which are its adoption premises.
Lifecycle and adoption remain source-owned. A changed member,
selected basis, source declaration or adoption premise requires fresh
applicability before use. An activation lacking the source meaning,
adoption or authority binding reports that unresolved relation before
dependent reliance rather than interpreting it from equal spelling (P3,
P5). For an evaluation that depends on the imported concept, a missing
source meaning, adoption or authority binding is an undeclared material
relation, the ground of `out_of_frame` ([Results](#results), Out of frame
or indeterminate); a changed member or basis whose applicability is not
yet re-established is the ground of `invalid_basis` (§4 Results).

Purpose and material relation of the declaration's contents, its two
forms, a member as source context and the two grounds above: a concept
used outside its owning section keeps one meaning and one owner, so two
members cannot answer one question two ways, and using a concept grants
no authority over it (P1, P6).

### RF-001 Evaluation relativity

Every frame declares the evaluation family it supports. A frame with no
declared evaluation family has no testable sufficiency boundary (P2; rc.2
#rf-001-evaluation-relativity).

### RF-005 Exact basis and coordinates

Every result binds its exact subject, basis, coordinates and evidence
scope. A stale, advanced, ambiguous or mismatched basis returns
`invalid_basis` or requires reactivation. Apparent equality never
substitutes for declared coordinate equality (P3, P1; rc.2
#rf-005-exact-basis-and-coordinates).

### RF-008 Overlap without identity collapse

Frames may share entities, variables, evidence or coordinates. Shared
material establishes neither identical meaning nor identical basis,
authority or result. Every cross-frame equality or translation an
evaluation uses is declared where it is used (P1, P3; rc.2
#rf-008-overlap-without-identity-collapse).

### RF-010 Composition on demand

Using several frames does not require composing their internal manifolds.
Composition law is required only when the governing evaluation combines
their internal variables, transports evidence or values across them, or
treats their operations as one material execution relation. Independently
activated evaluations may instead return closed results to one declared
conjunction or decision rule (P4a; §6; rc.2
#rf-010-composition-on-demand).


Source: REFERENCE_FRAME.md#rf-011-topology-mutation-and-recharting sha256=92464e86126e807e8e225a08c8d42ce929f11b823dfb07e204b34ff1b3ae57bc

### RF-011 Topology mutation and recharting

An activated frame declares the topology changes capable of invalidating
its coordinates or its materiality judgment. A detected material topology
mutation causes reevaluation, frame revision or recharting before the
previous result is reused. Material revision of the frame itself
invalidates for reuse every result bound to the prior revision coordinate;
§10 Revision actions states that rule (P3, P4b; rc.2
#rf-011-topology-mutation-and-recharting).

### RF-012 Closed results

Every performed evaluation of a frame returns one closed result in the
frame's declared result algebra: the core algebra of
[FOUNDATIONS §4 Results](FOUNDATIONS.md#results), or a refinement mapped
into it under that section. That section owns the five core values
(`satisfied`, `falsified`, `indeterminate`, `out_of_frame` and
`invalid_basis`), their meanings and the rules over them: that nothing is
coerced to success; that a refinement adds no core value, keeps
indeterminate, out-of-frame and invalid-basis pressure explicit and raises
no result's standing; and that an evaluation not performed has no result,
its stop state being
[ACTIVATION §3](ACTIVATION.md#3-step-results-and-disposition). This law
applies them to every frame and defines none of them (P5; rc.2
#rf-012-closed-results).

### RF-015 Residual uncertainty

Coverage and evaluation results retain known uncertainty. Unresolved
relations, uncovered evaluations, contested evidence and unknown capability
stay explicit. Absence of a recorded counterexample is not evidence of
universal completeness (P4b, P6; open-world premise; rc.2
#rf-015-residual-uncertainty).

## 4. Frame-set declaration

Human authority may declare an initial project frame set from accumulated
development practice, known failure modes, domain expertise, the governed
outcome's risk and knowledge of the available agents and other actors. The
declaration need not reconstruct the set from the workspace bottom up (P6,
P2; rc.2 #human-frame-set-declaration). It records:

- the governed workspace and outcome;
- the known evaluation inventory;
- the selected frames and their capability envelopes;
- intentional overlaps and separately activated checks;
- known frame dependencies or translations;
- semantic, evaluation, operation where material, decision and acceptance
  authority;
- known exclusions and residual uncertainty; and
- the conditions for revision.

Human selection is a lawful source of method structure. It proves neither
that the selected set is complete nor that the frames hold authority over
the subject relations they inspect (P6; RF-006, RF-015).

### Frame-set selection

Frame-set selection is a constrained coverage problem. For the known
material evaluations E(W, G) of workspace W and governed outcome G, a
selected frame set S meets the baseline coverage constraint when, for every
evaluation e in E(W, G), there is a frame F in S and an available actor a
inside F's capability envelope K_F such that F with a is capable of e (P2,
P0; rc.2 #frame-set-optimization). Selection also weighs actor context and
competence; evaluation risk and consequence; acquisition and reasoning
cost; evidence availability; useful independently activated overlap;
translation and reconciliation cost; historical blind spots; and
reversibility when the set proves inadequate. No optimisation algorithm is
prescribed. Human authority may accept a non-minimal set where its added
cost buys material risk reduction or better actor fit (P2, P6).

These considerations create no universal resource ledger, benchmark, budget
or measurement gate. A resource control applies only through an explicitly
selected frame and its owning applicability and work scope; ACTIVATION §6
is that selection where a cost claim is the governed question. The test
that an activated frame's context fits the selected actor is RF-002's,
distinct from the actor context that selection weighs, and
[ACTIVATION §2](ACTIVATION.md#2-context-construction-under-an-envelope)
owns its measurement and when the measurement applies. Frame selection
cannot waive another applicable semantic, authority, evidence or
independence constraint (P2, P6).

## 5. Method functions

The frame and the functions over it remain distinct. An application may
realise the following relations in any conforming form; the signatures
describe relations, not callable software interfaces (P2; RF-016; rc.2
#method-functions):

```text
declare(human_authority, workspace, outcome, practices, capabilities)
  -> frame_set

activate(frame, evaluation, subject, basis, actor)
  -> activated_frame | activation_refusal

evaluate(activated_frame, admissible_evidence)
  -> result + evidence + residuals

conjoin(decision_rule, frame_results)
  -> decision | conflict | indeterminate

translate(source_frame, target_frame, value_or_evidence, mapping)
  -> translated_value | declared_loss | refusal

audit_coverage(workspace, outcome, evaluation_inventory, frame_set)
  -> coverage_ledger

revise(frame_set, new_evidence, failures, capability_change, topology_change)
  -> proposed_frame_set_delta
```

`declare` is §4; `activate` and `evaluate` are ACTIVATION §1 and §2;
`evaluate` returns its result under RF-012, and the closed result is
returned and reused under ACTIVATION §7; `conjoin` and `translate` are §6;
`audit_coverage` is §8, which maps the statuses of its ledger to the core;
`revise` is §10. EVALUATION §7 qualifies each.

The outcomes of `activate`, `conjoin` and `translate` form a refinement of
the core algebra, stated under the refinement rule of
[FOUNDATIONS §4 Results](FOUNDATIONS.md#results): each outcome below maps
to exactly one core value for the predicate its function names, the value
travels with that predicate and with the outcome, whose meaning stays here,
and an outcome named in the signatures above that would map to more than
one core value according to its cause carries the cause in its name, as in
`activation_refusal(basis)` (P5, P6). The refinement is new in this
corpus. Purpose and material relation: a consumer that combines these
outcomes with other results reads them in the one core, so a refusal, a
conflict or a loss outside the accepted loss is neither mistaken for
success nor merged with an evaluation that was not performed.

| Function and predicate | Outcome | Cause | Core value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `activate`: the frame is activated for this evaluation, subject, basis and actor | `activated_frame` | the frame declaration is bound to the exact evaluation, subject, basis and actor | `satisfied` |
| | `activation_refusal(capability)` | the frame declares a capability the evaluation needs, and the selected actor's declared envelope lacks it; the refusal names that capability and its owner where the subject gives one | `out_of_frame` |
| | `activation_refusal(authority)` | the activation needs semantic, evaluation, operation or decision authority that is not admitted to it; the refusal names that authority's owner | `out_of_frame` |
| | `activation_refusal(basis)` | the subject or basis is stale, advanced, ambiguous or mismatched (RF-005), a topology mismatch included: the subject's topology is not the topology basis the frame declares (RF-011) | `invalid_basis` |
| `conjoin`: the composite predicate holds under the declared decision rule | `decision(holds)` | the conjunction of FOUNDATIONS §4 reports `satisfied` | `satisfied` |
| | `decision(fails)` | the conjunction reports `falsified`, and no mandatory result for the same claim is `satisfied` | `falsified` |
| | `conflict` | the conjunction reports `falsified` while mandatory results for the same claim disagree, one `satisfied` and another `falsified`; the counterexample survives the join, and the disagreement stays unresolved for the decision authority | `falsified` |
| | `indeterminate` | the conjunction reports `indeterminate` | `indeterminate` |
| `translate`: the value or evidence enters the target frame as the declared translation states | `translated_value` | the value or evidence is carried into the target coordinates with its declared meaning | `satisfied` |
| | `declared_loss` | the value or evidence is carried with a loss inside the declared accepted loss; the loss travels with it as a residual (P4b) | `satisfied` |
| | `refusal(condition)` | a refusal condition the translation declares holds, a loss outside the accepted loss included; or the value or evidence fails identity or equality under the translation's declared equality law | `falsified` |
| | `refusal(authority)` | an authority mismatch the translation does not declare: the value or evidence carries semantic, evaluation, operation or decision authority whose relation to the target frame's authority the translation states neither as preserved nor as a refusal condition; the refusal names that authority's owner | `out_of_frame` |
| | `refusal(basis)` | the source value or evidence binds a stale, advanced, ambiguous or mismatched basis or coordinate (RF-005) | `invalid_basis` |

Where no frame the actor can use declares a material relation or
capability the evaluation needs, `activate` returns `out_of_frame` itself
([ACTIVATION §2](ACTIVATION.md#2-context-construction-under-an-envelope),
Activation). Where the conjunction reports `out_of_frame` or
`invalid_basis`, `conjoin` returns that value; the signatures name no
outcome for either case, and the `refusal` that EVALUATION §7 names for
`conjoin` on a basis mismatch is this returned `invalid_basis`. Under a
declared veto or deferral, `conjoin` returns the outcome above whose cause
holds for the value the conjunction reports
([FOUNDATIONS §4](FOUNDATIONS.md#conjunction-of-results)), or that value
itself where it is `out_of_frame` or `invalid_basis`. A planned
assessment without a closed result, and required coverage that no planned
assessment addresses, are no outcome of `conjoin`:
[FOUNDATIONS §4](FOUNDATIONS.md#conjunction-of-results) records them
beside the reported value, and they map to no core value. The outcomes of
`activate` answer whether a frame was activated, never the
evaluation's claim: a refused activation performs no evaluation.
`decision(holds)` assesses the composite predicate and is not its
acceptance, which is a separate result
([FOUNDATIONS §4](FOUNDATIONS.md#results)).


Source: REFERENCE_FRAME.md#6-frames-in-conjunction sha256=92464e86126e807e8e225a08c8d42ce929f11b823dfb07e204b34ff1b3ae57bc

## 6. Frames in conjunction

Frames act together through four distinct relations, and only where the
evaluation requires one (P4a; RF-010; rc.2 #using-frames-in-conjunction).

### Independently activated co-evaluation

Several frames may evaluate the same subject through separate activations
and return closed results. They may overlap in subject, manifold or
evidence sources; neither evaluation consumes or influences the other's
unclosed working result. This serves assurance independence, different
evidence altitudes and distinct failure perspectives (P6; FOUNDATIONS §2,
evaluation independence; rc.2 #independently-activated-co-evaluation).

### Result conjunction

A declared decision rule consumes the closed results of several frames.
The rule, what it must state, and the conjunction it computes are
[FOUNDATIONS §4 Conjunction of results](FOUNDATIONS.md#conjunction-of-results),
over the core values of [FOUNDATIONS §4 Results](FOUNDATIONS.md#results);
this member defines no conjunction of its own. The outcomes of `conjoin`
map to the core as §5 states (P4a, P5, P6; rc.2 #result-conjunction).

### Evidence or coordinate translation

One frame supplies evidence or a value consumed inside another. The
translation declares source and target coordinates, preserved meaning,
accepted loss, provenance, equality law and refusal conditions (P1, P4b;
rc.2 #evidence-or-coordinate-translation).

### Material composition

Several frame-governed operations form one material execution or reasoning
relation. The owning application declares the composition, the shared
invariants, the effect or decision order where material, closure, failure,
and the conservation of semantic, operation and decision authority.
Composition is introduced only when the evaluation requires it; a possible
future interaction does not require a general composition law in every
frame (P4a, P6, P2; rc.2 #material-composition).


Source: REFERENCE_FRAME.md#8-workspace-coverage sha256=92464e86126e807e8e225a08c8d42ce929f11b823dfb07e204b34ff1b3ae57bc

## 8. Workspace coverage

### Coverage basis

Coverage is evaluated against the tuple Coverage(W, G, B, E, S, T): the
workspace W, the governed outcome G, the exact basis B, the known
evaluation inventory E, the declared frame set S and the time or immutable
checkpoint T of the claim. Changing any material member may invalidate the
coverage result (P3, P6; rc.2 #coverage-basis).

### Evaluation inventory

The coverage evaluator derives the known evaluation inventory from every
material available source, including where applicable: goals, intent,
product definition, requirements and accepted method; accepted design, its
ontology, identities, lifecycles, authorities and algorithms;
implementation capabilities and externally observable behaviour;
operational, release, security, safety and governance obligations; direct
and indirect dependencies and interaction seams; evidence, tests,
scenarios, qualification and acceptance claims; historical tickets,
check-ins, commentary, post-mortems, incidents and rejected candidates;
days-long loops, resets, repeated repairs and discovered rival paths; known
agent capability limits and prior invisible violations; and applicable
external law, contracts or standards. The inventory records provenance and
materiality. Artifact presence, file count, operation count, test count or
repository reachability proves no evaluation coverage (P2, P6; rc.2
#evaluation-inventory).

### Coverage dimensions

The audit applies cross-cutting lenses to the inventory. Typical
dimensions are outcome and capability; identity and authority; lifecycle
and temporal behaviour; topology and interaction seams; transport and
representation; evidence and proof; change, failure, recovery and
rollback; historical regression; and actor capability and context fit.
These are lenses (FOUNDATIONS §2): they become frames only when separately
instantiated as bounded evaluation families (P2; rc.2
#coverage-dimensions).

### Coverage ledger

The ledger holds at least, for each evaluation (P4b, P6; rc.2
#coverage-ledger):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| evaluation | the exact question or predicate |
| provenance | the source establishing materiality |
| subject and basis | the exact workspace coordinate |
| selected frames | the frames capable of evaluating it |
| actor envelope | the competence and context required |
| semantic authority | the owner of the evaluated meaning |
| operation authority | the existing owner grant for construction, transformation, admission, publication or mutation where the evaluation performs one; otherwise none |
| decision authority | the owner of the disposition |
| evidence | the required observations and their provenance |
| dependencies | material frame or seam relations |
| status | the coverage disposition |
| residual | uncertainty, exclusion or re-entry condition |

The baseline coverage statuses are `covered`, `separately_covered`,
`conditionally_covered`, `conflicted`, `uncovered`, `unknown` and
`excluded_by_authority`.

The statuses form a refinement of the core, stated under the refinement
rule of [FOUNDATIONS §4 Results](FOUNDATIONS.md#results). They answer
whether a row's coverage obligation is met, for the predicate "on the
declared coverage tuple, a capable frame of S covers the evaluation with
no unresolved conflict among the frames, results or authorities that
cover it, or a governing authority the row cites excludes it". Each status
maps to exactly one core value, and the value travels with that predicate
and with the status, whose meaning stays here (P5, P6):

| Status | Cause | Core value |
|---|---|---|
| `covered` | a capable frame of S evaluates it on the tuple, with no unresolved conflict among what covers it | `satisfied` |
| `separately_covered` | separately activated frames of S each evaluate it on the tuple, with no unresolved conflict among them (High-risk separately activated coverage) | `satisfied` |
| `excluded_by_authority` | the governing authority the row cites excludes the evaluation from the claim (Operational full coverage, item 7) | `satisfied` |
| `conditionally_covered` | a capable frame of S covers it only under a condition the audit has not established; the residual names the condition and the evidence that would decide it | `indeterminate` |
| `conflicted` | the frames, results or authorities that cover it conflict, and the conflict is unresolved; the conflict is the counterexample and stays unresolved for the decision authority (Operational full coverage, item 6) | `falsified` |
| `uncovered` | no capable frame of S evaluates it, and no cited authority excludes it; that absence is the counterexample | `falsified` |
| `unknown` | the admissible evidence cannot decide whether a capable frame of S covers it, as where the actor capability or the materiality is unknown | `indeterminate` |

These values are results of `audit_coverage` for this predicate, never
results of the covered evaluation itself. `satisfied` for an excluded row
establishes that the obligation is met by the cited exclusion, never that
the evaluation is covered or was performed; the status keeps that
distinction (FOUNDATIONS §4 Results, Recording). In a conjunction over the
governed claim, an evaluation whose row is `uncovered` is required
coverage that no planned assessment addresses
([FOUNDATIONS §4](FOUNDATIONS.md#conjunction-of-results)), never a
`falsified` component. Where the coverage tuple itself is stale, advanced,
ambiguous or mismatched, the audit returns `invalid_basis` (RF-005) and
assigns no status. The mapping is new in this corpus. Purpose and material
relation: a coverage claim combined with other results is read in the one
core, so a conditional, conflicted, unknown or uncovered row is never read
as covered, and a cited exclusion is never read as a failure (P5, P6).

### Interaction coverage

Evaluation-row coverage is insufficient when two covered relations interact
in a way capable of changing the governed outcome. Every material
interaction is covered by one frame, a declared conjunction, a translation
or a material composition evaluation (P4a, P2; rc.2
#interaction-coverage).

### Authority coverage

Every material evaluation identifies semantic and decision authority.
Every material operation also identifies its existing construction,
transformation, admission, publication or mutation authority. A frame set
with broad observational reach, an unresolved decision owner or an
effectful path without operation authority is not closed (P6; rc.2
#authority-coverage).

### Failure coverage

Coverage includes known success, refusal, boundary, integration, recovery,
reconstruction and competing-path cases where they are material.
Historical failures stay first-class coverage inputs until a declared frame
detects or excludes their recurrence (P4b, P5; rc.2 #failure-coverage).

### High-risk separately activated coverage

Human authority may require independently activated frame coverage for
evaluations whose failure has high consequence, weak observability, strong
confirmation bias or a history of local proof masking. Such coverage uses a
separately activated evaluation relation and declares any additional
assurance-independence conditions. A persona label alone establishes
neither relation (P6; rc.2 #high-risk-separately-activated-coverage).

### Operational full coverage

A frame set has operational full coverage for its declared tuple when
(rc.2 #operational-full-coverage):

1. every known material evaluation is covered by at least one capable
   frame;
2. every material interaction has a declared evaluation, conjunction,
   translation or composition relation;
3. every evaluation has semantic and decision authority, and every
   material operation has its inherited operation authority;
4. every mandatory claim has an admissible evidence path and a refusal
   path;
5. the required independently activated overlaps and
   assurance-independence conditions are present;
6. no unresolved frame-result conflict is hidden by aggregation;
7. excluded evaluations cite their governing authority; and
8. uncovered and unknown residuals are explicit and compatible with the
   claim.

Operational full coverage is relative to its tuple. It is not a claim that
no undiscovered evaluation exists (P6; P0 with the open-world premise).


Source: REFERENCE_FRAME.md#10-discovery-and-revision sha256=92464e86126e807e8e225a08c8d42ce929f11b823dfb07e204b34ff1b3ae57bc

## 10. Discovery and revision

### Missing-frame signals

These observations trigger frame diagnosis (P4b, P5; rc.2
#missing-frame-signals):

- a competent actor repeatedly cannot see a known material violation;
- a local repair creates or duplicates another authority path;
- work repeatedly resets after apparently valid local completion;
- long implementation loops produce no stable closure;
- proof passes while the claimed outcome stays unbound;
- a material failure is visible only after broad integration;
- reviewers repeatedly expand context without reaching a decidable
  question;
- two actors use the same frame name but evaluate different material
  relations; or
- a topology mutation leaves prior verdicts apparently current.

### Diagnostic order

Diagnosis asks, in this order (P2; rc.2 #diagnostic-order):

1. Was the correct declared frame activated?
2. Were the subject and basis exact?
3. Was the actor inside the capability envelope?
4. Was admissible evidence available?
5. Is a material variable or invariant missing from the frame?
6. Is a required conjunction or translation missing?
7. Is the evaluation family itself wrong or incomplete?
8. Is another frame required?

Question 1 is answered by family inclusion, not by set membership. An
evaluation is within a frame's family when the question it decides is one
the frame's declared evaluation family states, at the frame's declared
coordinates (RF-001). Membership of the frame in the frame set, the frame's
name, a role label or similar wording of the question does not place an
evaluation in the frame's family; an activation of a frame on an evaluation
outside its family answers question 1 no, whatever the frame's standing in
the set. The test is a tightening the predecessor implies and does not
state (P2, the evaluations determine the attention surface; P1, a name
carries no meaning; the material relation drawn is evaluation-to-family
inclusion; rc.2 #diagnostic-order, #evaluation, where similar wording
proves no shared family, #rf-001-evaluation-relativity and
#applicability-and-required-results, where a frame name or listed family is
no activation trigger by itself).

The order prevents every difficult evaluation from creating another frame.

### Revision actions

A revision may (P4b; rc.2 #revision-actions): clarify activation or
evidence acquisition; change the capability envelope; add or remove a
material relation; split an overloaded frame; merge duplicative frames
where capability and authority stay sound; add intentional overlap; add or
revise a conjunction or translation; retire a frame whose evaluation family
is no longer material; or revise the project evaluation inventory. Every
material revision changes frame identity or revision coordinates and states
which prior activations, results and coverage claims require reevaluation
(P3, P4b).

Stated plainly: a material revision of a frame produces a new frame
revision coordinate. Every prior closed result bound to the previous
revision of a materially revised frame is bound to a mismatched coordinate
(RF-005) and is invalidated for reuse until it is re-checked against the
new revision (RF-011; ACTIVATION §7). The revision record lists those
results as reopened; a result leaves that list only by a recorded re-check
that finds it demonstrably independent of the change, or by re-evaluation
on the new revision. A material revision does not select which of the
results bound to the prior revision it reopens, and silence does not keep
a result closed. A non-material revision, for example one that clarifies an
activation or acquires evidence without changing any declaration, produces
no new coordinate and reopens no result; the revision record states that
the revision is non-material. This restates what RF-005, RF-011 and the sentence
above carry in combination (P3, P4b; rc.2 #revision-actions,
#rf-005-exact-basis-and-coordinates, #return-a-closed-result, whose
demonstrably independent surviving results are the re-check's one
survival route).


Source: ACTIVATION.md#7-closed-result-and-reuse sha256=179a3368a8daee4eae477ace858bc77c42c1a2bc86a76293dc54c25ee759eaed

## 7. Closed result and reuse

A closed result identifies the frame and its activation, the subject, the
basis, the evaluation, the actor, the evidence, the verdict, the residual
uncertainty and the invalidation conditions (the minimal shape is
REFERENCE_FRAME §13). The frame's internal working context is not
transferred when the closed result and its provenance are sufficient for
the consuming decision (P4b, P0; rc.2 RF #return-a-closed-result).

A closed result is reused by an unchanged consumer that checks exact
applicability; a role, conversation or resumption change alone invalidates
nothing. Changed material inputs or a declared revising observation
invalidate the affected result before reliance, even where the subject's
own bytes are unchanged, preserving its
predecessor/successor relation and any demonstrably independent surviving
results; a changed basis invalidates
likewise (judgment continuity names basis; Return A Closed Result names
inputs and observation). A reused judgment does not
satisfy a separately required independent judgment; the independent assessor
acquires its own evidence and supplies its own judgment. Conserves
[Return A Closed Result](stdo://releases/v2.5.1-rc.2/standards/REFERENCE_FRAME_METHOD.md#return-a-closed-result),
[judgment continuity](stdo://releases/v2.5.1-rc.2/standards/TICKET_METHOD.md#recorded-judgment-and-owner-ruling-continuity).

### Transition evidence

A reviewable transition identifies the exact candidate, the affected
relations, the changed realisation paths, the authority paths added or
removed, the retained and open seams, the focused proof, any required
integration proof, the explicit non-changes, and the decision owner's
disposition or the assessor's recommended disposition (§3). Consumers
choose the representation. Transition evidence is a read
model; it does not become specification, design or admission authority
(P6, P4b; provenance rc.2 SPEC_METHOD
#transition-evidence-and-proof-cadence).

Construction uses the cheapest focused proof capable of falsifying the
active relation. Expensive whole-candidate qualification occurs at a
declared candidate boundary rather than after every local edit, unless the
affected risk makes whole-candidate proof necessary (§6). A durable or
reconstructable authority claim is not established solely by a same-process
proof when loss of incidental process state is a material counterexample:
the proof destroys or excludes the incidental authority and compares the
reconstructed semantic outcomes (P5, P6).


Source: FOUNDATIONS.md#results sha256=259ef2fe5f1d6056d237c5ff0cdc0c051f89606f53e85c2137c9398cf6fafc71

### Results

Every performed evaluation returns one value of the core result algebra,
directly or as a refined value mapped into it (P5):

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `satisfied` | the declared predicate holds on the exact basis |
| `falsified` | a declared counterexample defeats it |
| `indeterminate` | the available admissible evidence cannot decide it |
| `out_of_frame` | the evaluation requires an undeclared material relation or capability |
| `invalid_basis` | the subject or basis cannot support the evaluation |

This core is the only one. Results of constraints, judgments, frame
evaluations, stops, work steps and effects are stated in it or in a
refinement mapped into it, so that results from any members combine under
one rule ([Conjunction of results](#conjunction-of-results)). Purpose and
material relation: no combination can report success while a failure, an
undecided question, an unperformed evaluation or an uncertain effect
remains, and none of these can be mistaken for another (P5, P6).

Recording. A result records its core value together with the predicate
evaluated and the original domain outcome, which is the refined value
where a refinement produced it. A mapping into the core never owns domain
meaning: the member, profile or adopting Product that defines the refined
value keeps it, and a consumer that needs the domain distinction reads the
domain outcome, never the core value alone (P1, P6).

Standing. The standing of a result is what it establishes about its
predicate; it is distinct from the standing of a commitment (§1). Only
`satisfied` establishes the predicate. `falsified` establishes that the
predicate fails and names the counterexample. `indeterminate`,
`out_of_frame` and `invalid_basis` establish neither, and each names what
would decide: the evidence, the missing relation or capability with its
owner where the subject gives one, or the basis repair. By support for the
predicate, `satisfied` stands above each other value, and the other four
are not ordered among themselves.

No refinement or mapping raises a result's standing (P5, P6):

- a falsified or failed result never maps to a satisfied or successful one;
- a result that admissible evidence cannot decide never maps to
  `satisfied`;
- an evaluation that was not performed stays distinct from one whose
  evidence cannot decide: it has no
  [closed result](ACTIVATION.md#7-closed-result-and-reuse), and it is never mapped
  to `indeterminate` or to any other core value;
- an effect whose completion is unknown never maps to no effect or to
  completed.

Not performed. An evaluation that is required or planned and was not
performed has no closed result; an actor cannot report an evaluation it
did not perform (P6). Nothing is coerced to success: a failed,
indeterminate, out-of-frame, out-of-scope or invalid-basis result follows
the declared result algebra and returns its own value under it, never
`satisfied`, and a missing result, being no result, enters every
conjunction over it as a gap: a planned assessment without a closed result
where an assessment was planned, and uncovered coverage where none was.
This
conserves
[RF-012](stdo://releases/v2.5.1-rc.2/standards/REFERENCE_FRAME_METHOD.md#rf-012-closed-results),
whose five values the table restates unchanged, and
[AC-007](stdo://releases/v2.5.1-rc.2/standards/AXIOMATIC_CALCULUS.md#ac-007-constraint-and-refusal),
whose rule that a failed, missing, indeterminate, out-of-scope or
invalid-basis result follows the declared algebra rather than being
coerced to success is the sentence before; both are restated here once.
[REFERENCE_FRAME §3](REFERENCE_FRAME.md#rf-012-closed-results) states
RF-012 as a law over frames and
[AXIOMATIC_CALCULUS §4](AXIOMATIC_CALCULUS.md#ac-007-constraint-and-refusal)
states AC-007 as a law over constraints; each uses this core and neither
defines it again.

Refinements. A member, profile or adopting Product that needs finer
outcomes defines a refinement. The refinement names the question it
answers and the predicate its mapping is for, and maps every refined value
to exactly one core value. No outcome exists outside the core; a
refinement adds no core value and keeps the pressure of `indeterminate`,
`out_of_frame` and `invalid_basis` explicit. Where a refined value would
map to one of two core values according to its cause, the cause is part of
the refined value and each resulting value maps once (P5, P1). A further
refinement, by a member, profile, project or adopting Product, may split a
refined value by cause. The parent-value rule governs every such split:
each child value names its parent value and its cause and keeps its
parent's core value; a child that needs a different core value needs a
different parent value, which only the owner of the parent declares; and
no child takes `satisfied` from a parent that is not `satisfied`. No
further refinement raises a result's standing (P5, P6, P1). Purpose and
material relation: a consumer that reads a parent value reads the same
core value from each of its children, so a split by cause adds a domain
distinction and never changes what the parent establishes (P5, P6). The
refinements for admission, activation and steps are
[ACTIVATION §3](ACTIVATION.md#3-step-results-and-disposition); each other
member, profile and adopting Product states its mapping where it defines
its values.

Availability, assessment and acceptance are separate results, each with its
own predicate: that a step produced a candidate; that the candidate meets
its declared criteria; and that the
[decision owner](ACTIVATION.md#roles-and-delegation) accepts it at its
boundary. A step having produced a candidate never maps to the candidate's
fitness or acceptance, and acceptance is never inferred from a successful
step (P6; [ACTIVATION §3](ACTIVATION.md#3-step-results-and-disposition),
[EVALUATION §4](EVALUATION.md#4-review-results) and
[§5](EVALUATION.md#5-acceptance)).

Out of frame or indeterminate. The boundary between these values is drawn
on what the activated frame declares and on what the step did with it (P5,
finite capacity and graceful total handling; the material relation drawn
is the three-way out_of_frame boundary: capability not declared, capability
declared and exercised, capability declared and not exercised; rc.2 RF
#rf-012-closed-results). Three cases; the first two name core values, and
the third names none:

- `out_of_frame` when the claim requires a material relation or an
  evaluator capability that the activated frame does not declare. The
  result names the missing relation or capability, its owner where the
  subject gives one, and the reconfiguration pressure it creates
  ([ACTIVATION §4](ACTIVATION.md#4-totality-and-refinement); rc.2 RF
  #reconfigure-when-necessary). A term the claim depends on and the frame
  leaves undefined is an undeclared material relation: its meaning can
  alter the result and it enters through no declared input (rc.2 RF
  #material-relation, RF-003; P1). Whether the step exercised anything is
  irrelevant to this value; the ground is the missing declaration.
- `indeterminate` when the available admissible evidence cannot decide the
  claim (rc.2 RF-012). The result names the evidence that would decide, as
  its residual uncertainty (rc.2 RF #return-a-closed-result). Where the
  claim also depends on an undeclared relation or capability,
  `out_of_frame` and `indeterminate` each have a lawful ground; the result
  names the value it returns and that ground, and this boundary excludes
  neither (P5).
- no value of its own when the step did not exercise a declared capability
  the evaluation requires. A result is returned wherever a sufficient
  evaluation or an applicable judgment exists without that capability,
  identifying its evidence, verdict and residual uncertainty like any
  closed result (rc.2 RF #rf-012-closed-results, #return-a-closed-result):
  a counterexample found by what was exercised, as when source inspection
  falsifies A in a claim of A and B, returns `falsified`, and common
  agreement cannot discard it (rc.2 RF #result-conjunction). Where none
  exists because the capability was not exercised, the evaluation was not
  performed and has no result: the step's stop state carries it,
  `incomplete` under
  [construction availability](ACTIVATION.md#construction-availability), and
  its work state ([ACTIVATION §5](ACTIVATION.md#5-work-state-and-restart))
  carries the unexercised capability as a residual (P6). In either case
  the unexercised part, B above, has no result: in every conjunction over
  it, it is a planned assessment without a closed result, and the known
  failure A survives with it ([Conjunction of results](#conjunction-of-results)).
  The evaluation's result and the step's stop state answer different
  questions, so the step's stop value never becomes the evaluation's
  result.

Foundation to law for results and their combination (family F3). The
table covers every rule of §4 and the result grounds of §2 Imports
between members, in the format of
[Foundation to law](#foundation-to-law), which states the standing of its
consequences. Purpose and material relation: a reader of §4 sees which
commitments each result rule rests on and which choices it adds, with their
owners (P6, P2). Instance premises, which the commitments do not supply:
(i) an evaluation declares its predicate, subject and basis; (ii) results
of several evaluations, steps or members are combined into one decision;
(iii) members, profiles and adopting Products need outcomes finer than the
core.

### Conjunction of results

Conjunction combines results into one result for a composite predicate: a
claim made of component claims, a decision over several evaluations, or
the outer contract of composed steps. It is defined here once, over the
core. A member or profile that combines results applies this rule and
declares only the choices it leaves open (P4a, P4b, P5, P6). Purpose and
material relation: failure, undecidability, non-performance and uncertain
effects stay distinct after combination, so a composite can neither report
success nor hide which kind of gap it has while one of them remains in
what it requires.

A conjunction takes three inputs and keeps them apart:

1. the closed results returned, each a core value with its predicate and
   domain outcome;
2. the planned assessments that have no closed result applicable to the
   composite: evaluations the composite requires that were not performed,
   or whose result is absent, stale, bound to another subject or basis, or
   incapable of establishing its claim;
3. the required coverage that no planned assessment addresses: for a
   required obligation set R and the coverage C that the planned
   assessments admit, the uncovered coverage R minus C.

Gaps. A conjunction with any item in the second or third input is never
`satisfied`. Its record names which kind of gap it has, not performed,
uncovered or both, and each item. An uncovered obligation is never
reported as satisfied or as an omitted planned assessment; a planned
assessment without a closed result is never reported as uncovered or as an
`indeterminate` component.

Survival. Every known failure (a `falsified` result with its
counterexample), every planned assessment without a closed result and
every uncovered obligation is carried with the composite and survives every
join: combining conjunctions takes the union of known failures and of
planned assessments without a closed result, and recomputes uncovered
coverage over the combined obligations. A known failure and a gap of
either kind survive every join. Common agreement among contributors
cannot discard a constraint or a material counterexample that only one
contributor found. A missing, wrong-subject, conflicted or indeterminate
mandatory result stays unresolved under the declared rule, and aggregate
satisfied status cannot replace it (P4b, P5).

Predicates travel. Each component keeps its predicate and domain outcome
through every join, so an uncertain effect stays distinct from a failure
and from an undecided claim, and a `satisfied` for one predicate never
counts toward another: a step's `satisfied` for "a candidate is available"
never counts toward the candidate's fitness or acceptance.

Reported value. The conjunction is `satisfied` only when every mandatory
result is `satisfied` with valid applicable evidence, the declared basis
relations agree, and the second and third inputs are empty. A composite
with a material counterexample to a mandatory constraint or an uncovered
required obligation cannot project success. Where a mandatory result is
not `satisfied`, the conjunction
reports a non-satisfied value chosen by its declared rule from those
returned; no universal order among the non-satisfied values exists, and
the member or profile that applies the conjunction declares its own in
its declared rule. Where every mandatory returned result is `satisfied`
and the declared basis relations disagree, the conjunction reports
`invalid_basis`, because no coherent composite basis supports the
composite predicate (§2, Basis); any gaps stay recorded by kind. Where
every mandatory returned result is `satisfied`, the declared basis
relations agree and a gap remains, the conjunction reports
`indeterminate`, because the results it holds cannot decide the composite
predicate; that value is the conjunction's own, and the gaps stay
recorded by kind. A `falsified` result that is not mandatory stays in the
conjunction's record with its predicate and is never discarded. Where
every mandatory result is `satisfied`, the declared basis relations agree
and no gap remains, a material counterexample to a mandatory constraint
falsifies the conjunction whichever contributor found it, and without one
the conjunction's value is the one its declared rule gives over the
mandatory results.

The declared rule. A conjunction declares which results are mandatory; how
conflict and indeterminacy are handled; which basis relations must agree,
results on different bases combining only under a declared coherent
composite basis (§2, Basis); which decision authority owns the
conjunction; how results that are not mandatory count; and whether any
result may veto or defer the decision.
Conjunction does not transfer the semantic authority of a contributing
evaluation (P6, P4a).

Composition of results. The result of composed steps for the outer
predicate is the conjunction of the steps' results, with the outer
contract's obligations as the required coverage. That each step returned
`satisfied` supports the outer predicate only where the refinement's
premises hold ([ACTIVATION §4](ACTIVATION.md#4-totality-and-refinement),
Refinement).

===== TASK =====
# TASK B: coverage ledger, diagnostic order, revision action

## Subject

Workspace `W-notify`: a notification service. The facts below are the whole
subject; the record is invented for this task and is evidence about no real
product.

Governed outcome G: release 1.4 of `notify` ships with no duplicate sends.

Basis B: source commit `9e1d2f44`, configuration revision 41 (revision 39
was current until 2026-10-11T08:00Z, when the retry window changed from
60 s to 300 s). Time of the claim T: 2026-10-11T12:00Z.

Declared frame set S (declared by the release owner, Tomas, who also holds
the release decision):

| Frame | Evaluation family as declared | Capability envelope |
|---|---|---|
| F-A `delivery` | "delivery behaviour of the sender on one commit" | an engineer with repository access and the staging replay harness |
| F-B `schema-compat` | "payload schema compatibility between producer and consumer revisions" | any actor with the two schema files |
| F-C `ops-readiness` | "operational state of the queues at a named time" | the operations lead with dashboard access |

Evaluation inventory E, with what has happened to each:

| Id | Evaluation | Provenance | History |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | no message is sent twice for one event | requirement NR-2 | activated in F-A on commit `9e1d2f44`, config rev 39; closed `satisfied` (replay of 10,000 events, 2026-10-10, zero duplicates) |
| E2 | schema v7 consumers accept v8 payloads | requirement NR-5 | activated in F-B on schema revisions 7 and 8; closed `satisfied` (contract test, 2026-10-09) |
| E3 | the retry policy bounds total sends to three per event | design note D-9 | activated in F-A on config rev 39; closed `satisfied` (2026-10-10); config advanced to rev 41 on 2026-10-11 |
| E4 | the dead-letter queue is empty before release | release checklist item 7 | two activations on the same basis: F-C returned `satisfied` (dashboard: 0 messages at 09:00Z); F-A returned `falsified` (log inspection: 12 messages stuck in `dlq-shadow` at 09:30Z); no rule for combining them has been declared |
| E5 | the rate limiter drops no events under a burst of 500/s | post-mortem of incident INC-77 | in the inventory; no frame activated |
| E6 | every consumer verifies webhook signatures | security obligation SEC-3 | in the inventory; no frame's evaluation family includes it; the decision owner for SEC-3 is not recorded |

Semantic authority: the product owner (Lena) owns the meaning of NR-2 and
NR-5; the platform team owns D-9; the security lead (Ari) owns SEC-3.
Operation authority: none of the evaluations performs a mutation.
Decision authority: Tomas for the release; SEC-3 unrecorded.

Observed signal, from the release meeting of 2026-10-11T11:00Z: the
reviewers asked twice for a wider log window on E4 and ended without a
decidable question; the engineer and the operations lead each said they
had "evaluated delivery", meaning E4 under F-A and under F-C respectively.

## Instruction

1. Produce the coverage ledger for the tuple (W-notify, G, B, E, S, T):
   one row per evaluation E1 to E6, with every ledger field the METHOD
   block names and a `status` from the statuses it names. Where a field's
   value is not in the subject, write what is missing rather than inventing
   it.
2. Apply the diagnostic order to the observed signal: answer each question
   in the order given, from the subject's facts, with `unknown` where the
   subject does not decide it, and stop the list at the first question
   whose answer locates the defect, stating why you stopped there.
3. Name one revision action from the actions the METHOD block names, say
   which frame or inventory it changes, and list which prior activations,
   results and coverage claims it reopens.
4. Under a heading `No method source`, list anything the task needed that
   the METHOD block did not supply; write `none` if nothing.

Return only those four parts, in that order. Do not restate the subject.
Do not propose product changes.
