## Result algebra

A result makes a claim about one predicate on one subject and basis. Its core
record contains the predicate, exact subject and basis, verdict, performance,
original qualified domain outcome, supporting evidence and citations, unresolved
obligations and material effect observations. A reference can carry these when
its resolution preserves their meaning and availability. This is a semantic
contract, not a mandatory serialization format or additional work carrier.

The verdict has exactly these values:

| Value | Meaning for the bound predicate |
|---|---|
| `satisfied` | Admissible evidence establishes the predicate under its declared evaluation rule. |
| `falsified` | Admissible evidence establishes a counterexample or failure of that predicate. |
| `indeterminate` | The available admissible evidence does not decide the predicate. |
| `out_of_frame` | The predicate is outside the evaluation's bound scope or capability; it is not silently omitted from the wider obligation. |
| `invalid_basis` | The subject, governing basis or required interpretation is invalid for the claimed evaluation. |

Performance records whether the named predicate's declared evaluation was
actually undertaken; it is `performed`, `not_performed` or `unconfirmed`.
The activation identifies that evaluation separately from dispatch, admission
or the work being assessed. Retain the observed extent, interruption and
conclusion in its outcome and evidence. The legal pairs are:

| Performance | Permitted verdicts | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `performed` | Any of the five verdicts | Evidence establishes that the evaluation was undertaken, including a scoped basis or capability diagnosis. Its extent and conclusion remain separate facts. |
| `not_performed` | Any except `satisfied`, with the evidence condition below | Evidence establishes that the evaluation was not undertaken. Dispatch or admission alone does not establish performance. |
| `unconfirmed` | Any except `satisfied`, with the evidence condition below | Whether the evaluation was undertaken is not established. |

An interruption does not erase evaluation already undertaken or admissible
evidence obtained. A suite aborted after a witnessed failure is performed with
that partial extent and falsifies “all tests pass”. A completed load test that
cannot generate its required load is performed but indeterminate on the
requested service-performance predicate. Neither case is a never-run test.
Satisfaction still requires all evidence and completion conditions selected by
the predicate's evaluation rule; performed alone proves none of them.

When the selected evaluation was not undertaken or its performance is
unconfirmed, separately admissible counterevidence to its bound predicate can
still establish falsified; an established basis or scope diagnosis can likewise
establish invalid_basis or out_of_frame. The result identifies that independent
support without inventing execution. Without deciding support it is
indeterminate. An absent return establishes neither non-performance nor an
undecidable evaluation: retain the missing slot and what is actually known.

A missing required judgment stays an absent coverage slot, with the known
performance fact or its uncertainty; it is not a fabricated child result. A
performed but undecidable evaluation differs from a known unperformed one and
from unconfirmed execution. A failed admission check can conclude while
downstream work does not. The plan fixes which predicates are required; a
precondition is evidence for its dependent evaluation unless the plan separately
requires that precondition as a predicate. A concluding basis/scope diagnosis
on P reports invalid_basis/out_of_frame on P with its supporting evidence; a
different admission predicate is not silently substituted for P. An aborted
procedure does not erase separately authenticated counterexamples observed
during the attempt. Every result projection preserves these
coordinates and the original predicate; a verdict alone is an insufficient
handoff where performance is material.

An effect observation is `not_requested`, `not_started`, `completed`, `partial`,
`reverted` or `unknown`, on its declared observation boundary. These values describe the selected effect and observation
boundary, not the predicate verdict. `not_started` needs evidence that the selected effect did not begin, including
an authenticated rejection before mutation. Transport dispatch alone proves
neither effect completion nor absence; `unknown` includes a lost acknowledgment
after possible execution.
`reverted` means that at least one part began and every begun part is observed to have been reversed within
the declared boundary, with the reversal and any unstarted remainder retained
as evidence. For every effect value, the boundary includes each material part
the operation may have affected under its supported operating model and any
observed departure, whether requested or unintended. Irreversible messages or
other material external effects cannot be omitted to improve a result.
`partial` means an observed
completed part and an observed unexecuted or reverted remainder.
If any material remainder has unknown completion, the state is `unknown`,
retaining the completed parts as evidence. An effect can be completed while
the intended product outcome is falsified.
An empty local log or discarded context does not establish no effect.
`not_requested` states an established effect-free scope under that operating
model; lack of a request alone is insufficient. A material possible unintended
effect without sufficient observation is `unknown`. If observation establishes
that an unrequested possible part did not begin, it contributes `not_requested`
at this boundary, retaining that observation and any earlier uncertainty.
It is not an uncompleted requested remainder. A requested part observed not to
begin remains `not_started`.

A refined value is the pair of original domain outcome and cause in its
declared reason domain, including an explicit missing-reason case. A domain
refinement preserves that qualified original outcome and supplies a
total, reason-sensitive map into this record. If the original outcome is too
coarse to determine a verdict, its required reason distinguishes the cases; a
consumer cannot guess from a word such as `refused`, `ready` or `accepted`.
A missing required reason maps the claimed predicate to indeterminate and
leaves that contribution inadmissible as deciding support for its slot;
retain its raw outcome and unresolved authentication. Its claimed predicate
remains indeterminate until admissible evidence decides it. Independently
established counterevidence or a basis/scope diagnosis uses the legal pairs above
on that same bound predicate; it does not invent execution or completion.
Requested or material possible unintended effects without sufficient observation
are unknown, never defaulted to not_requested. Unconfirmed evaluation performance
stays unconfirmed. Domain meaning stays with its domain owner.
No refinement turns failure, undecidability, non-performance or unknown effect
completion into greater standing. A new result over a different predicate does
not overwrite the earlier result.

Candidate availability, candidate fitness and authorised acceptance are three
predicates. `candidate_ready` can satisfy availability while fitness remains
falsified or unassessed. A lawful yield can satisfy the selected yielding
contract while product completion remains unresolved. A decision result binds
the predicate “disposition D on subject S at basis B was made under mandate M
by its bound authority”. A lawful rejection can satisfy that predicate while
candidate fitness remains undecided. Recording the decision is not its authority.
A not-applicable classification needs a supported applicability judgment; it is
never a synonym for a missing evaluation.

A stop reports the actual destination or task predicate through this record,
with its reason, observed effects and outstanding obligations. Its verdict
is indeterminate when the outcome remains undecided, falsified when admissible
evidence defeats that predicate, or the established scope/basis diagnosis.
Lawfulness of stopping is a separate decision predicate.
