# Release Method

## Release-Publication Context

`RELEASE_METHOD.md` owns the release-publication bounded context
`urn:stdo:bounded-context:release-publication` under the selected complete STDO
basis. It owns the identities and transitions used to qualify, publish, and
select released cuts. It does not own Product meaning or consumer adoption.

## Position

Release process is distinct from live project specification.

Live specification defines the current constitutional truth of the project.
Release process defines how one published point-in-time cut is evaluated,
bounded, named, published, and made discoverable.

The product-local cut name is always:

```text
v<version>-rc.<n>
```

In a release source carrying one independently released project, that name may
also be the Git tag name. In a shared release source it is the suffix of the
project-qualified Git ref defined below. Equal product-local cut names do not
collapse releases owned by different projects.

The product-local version-line selector name is:

```text
v<version>
```

It denotes a mutable **Version-Line Selector**. The selector points to the
latest published immutable RC cut on that line, where latest means the greatest
positive RC ordinal published for that project and version line. It is
convenient discovery, not immutable identity and not sufficient as an exact
constitutional, dependency, evidence, or replay basis.

Release handling is downstream of intake triage. A bug, feature, regression,
or release blocker first receives its change class, lawful re-entry point,
affected scope, downstream proof obligations, and version-line disposition.
The existence of an RC window does not authorize untriaged mutation.

## Release Identities

The release-publication context distinguishes:

- **Project Release Namespace** — a stable repository-local key assigned by the
  Product release authority to one independently released source project;
- **Project Subtree** — the exact repository-relative source-project root and
  Git tree object selected for one cut;
- **Candidate Source** — mutable source-project state constructing a possible
  successor;
- **RC Branch** — a mutable project-qualified carrier for the current candidate
  window;
- **Immutable RC Cut** — an annotated project-qualified Git tag plus its exact
  Product release subject, naming one published candidate and, once accepted,
  one released Product;
- **Version-Line Selector** — the mutable project-qualified tag alias naming
  the highest-ordinal published immutable RC cut for that project and version
  line; and
- **Release Branch** — an optional mutable project-qualified convenience
  carrier aligned to the same latest-published commit as the selector.

Equal version text does not collapse these identities. Branches and the
version-line selector may move. An immutable RC tag never moves.

## Project-Qualified Git Refs

`<project>` is one explicit Project Release Namespace. It matches
`[a-z0-9]+(?:[-_][a-z0-9]+)*`, contains no slash, is unique within the release
source, and remains stable for the continuing release line. It is assigned by
the Product release authority. A directory name, display name, definition
label, package name, or matching version cannot infer or reassign it.

A shared release source uses these exact ref shapes for every future
publication:

```text
RC branch:              refs/heads/rc/<project>/<version>
immutable RC cut tag:   refs/tags/<project>/v<version>-rc.<n>
version-line selector:  refs/tags/<project>/v<version>
release branch:         refs/heads/release/<project>/<version>
```

The short Git tag names are therefore `<project>/v<version>-rc.<n>` and
`<project>/v<version>`. A shared release source must not publish a future cut or
selector under the unqualified `v<version>-rc.<n>` or `v<version>` refs.

A single-project release source may retain the unqualified ref profile only
while it has exactly one independently released project and its release record
declares that profile. Adding a second independently released project requires
project-qualified refs before either project publishes another cut.

For the Specification Stack shared source, the allocated namespaces are
`specification_methodology`, `axiom_indexer`, and `stdo_representation`. These
keys distinguish release refs; they do not merge the three Products or imply a
dependency or composition relation.

## Project-Subtree Release Identity

In a shared release source, an immutable cut binds all of:

- the Project Release Namespace and owning Product authority;
- the exact qualified Git ref and annotated tag object;
- the peeled commit and repository-root tree;
- the normalized repository-relative Project Subtree root at that commit;
- the Git tree object at that exact Project Subtree root;
- the declared Product member inventory and release-scoped claim bytes; and
- the predecessor and successor dispositions required by this method.

The Project Subtree root is a locator inside the exact peeled commit, not
Product identity. Its canonical spelling is the slash-separated Git path from
the repository root, with no leading or trailing slash and no empty, `.`, or
`..` component; `.` alone denotes the repository root. Each non-root component
must name the exact tree entry bytes traversed at that commit. Moving a source
project changes this locator and its cut identity without reassigning the
Project Release Namespace. If the source project occupies the repository root,
its project-subtree tree equals the repository-root tree.

A tag over a monorepo commit does not make sibling subtrees Product members.
Unrelated sibling bytes remain carrier state outside the declared Product
subject. Conversely, a member inventory or payload digest without the
qualified ref, commit, Project Subtree root, and Project Subtree tree is not a
complete reacquirable release identity.

## Historical Ref And Public-URI Conservation

Project qualification is prospective. Existing unqualified refs retain their
names, objects, peels, and public links. A historical tag object may remain
reachable through an additional archival ref, but it is not recreated,
re-annotated, moved, or replaced. An immutable historical tag remains the same
object regardless of which preserving ref reaches it.

Product-local cut names and public logical release URIs also remain unchanged.
In particular, a logical STDO release remains
`stdo://releases/v<version>-rc.<n>/`; the project-qualified Git ref is transport
identity and is not inserted into that URI. Resolution binds the public logical
cut to its exact historical or project-qualified Git ref and fails closed if
one project-local coordinate names different tag objects.

When one version line spans the transition, latest means the greatest positive
RC ordinal across that project's preserved historical cuts and its qualified
future cuts. The first qualified publication creates the qualified selector.
The historical unqualified selector is preserved at its existing object and
ceases to be the current selector for the shared source; it is not force-moved
to imitate the qualified namespace.

## Phases

The release process has three phases:

1. mutable candidate construction;
2. immutable RC publication and monotonic version-line advancement; and
3. exact-cut qualification, acceptance, and explicit consumer adoption.

There is no second final cut after an accepted RC. Publication immediately
makes the new highest ordinal discoverable through the version-line selector;
acceptance remains a verdict over the exact immutable RC rather than a second
carrier. If any byte capable of affecting the Product or a release-scoped claim
changes, the project publishes and reviews a higher immutable RC cut instead.

## Mutable Candidate Construction

During candidate construction:

- bounded fixes are allowed after intake triage;
- qualification and operator review may continue;
- release notes may remain draft until RC publication;
- the RC branch may move; and
- mutable source is explicitly non-operative for released consumers.

The intended Product boundary, release-scoped claims, excluded source-project
state, and qualification basis become explicit before RC publication. A
material scope change is repriced instead of being silently absorbed.

## Immutable RC Publication

A published RC cut exists to provide one exact subject for review, replay, and
possible acceptance. To publish it, the project:

1. confirms the triaged scope and lawful constitutional re-entry;
2. declares the exact Product release subject and release-scoped claim set;
3. reconciles the release note and other release-facing assets to that subject;
4. runs the proportionate pre-RC qualification and operator checks;
5. commits the exact carrier;
6. resolves and records the exact Project Release Namespace, Project Subtree
   root, and Project Subtree tree;
7. creates one annotated immutable `<project>/v<version>-rc.<n>` tag and an
   annotated `<project>/v<version>` selector tag over that same commit in a
   shared release source;
8. atomically pushes the carrier, RC branch, immutable RC tag, selector, and
   optional release branch where the transport supports it;
9. verifies remotely that the immutable tag, selector, and release branch
   resolve to the highest published RC commit; and
10. records enough ref, subtree, identity, and inventory evidence to reacquire
    the cut without trusting a mutable checkout.

Each published RC tag is immutable. Further work increments `<n>` on the same
version line when the intended line remains applicable. It does not require a
minor-version increment merely because review found a bounded repair. A
published higher RC without matching selector advancement is an invalid,
fail-closed release state; it never authorizes resolution of the older cut as
the version-line latest.

## Exact-Cut Qualification

Qualification binds:

- the Project Release Namespace, qualified immutable RC ref, annotated tag
  object, peeled commit, repository tree, Project Subtree root and tree, and
  declared Product member set;
- the exact release-scoped claim bytes;
- the governing Product and release basis;
- each claimed property and its observation boundary;
- evidence subjects, owner verdicts, and unresolved gaps; and
- the complete successor relation to the declared predecessor.

Evidence matches the claim. Source success does not prove packaged or installed
behavior; packaging equivalence does not prove semantic behavior; artifact
presence does not prove usability unless presence is the exact claim.

An RC is accepted only when the required exact-cut review and operator checks
are complete and the human authority accepts that exact subject. If review
requires any qualifying-byte change, the verdict remains attached to the old
RC and a higher RC is published. The selector already advertises the highest
published RC; acceptance does not move it, rewrite it, or create another final
carrier.

## Monotonic Version-Line Advancement

Version-line advancement makes the newly published highest RC for one Project
Release Namespace discoverable:

1. identify the exact new immutable RC tag, ordinal, and peeled commit;
2. confirm that no higher RC ordinal already exists on that line;
3. confirm the project-qualified selector is absent or currently resolves to a
   lower RC ordinal on the same project line;
4. atomically create or force-update the annotated
   `<project>/v<version>` selector to the new highest RC commit;
5. create or update `release/<project>/<version>` to the same commit when that
   optional carrier is used;
6. push the carrier, RC branch, immutable RC tag, selector, and optional release
   branch atomically where the transport supports it; and
7. verify remotely that the selector peels to the highest RC commit and that
   the matching immutable annotated RC tag exists.

Advancement is refused when the target has no matching immutable annotated RC
tag, any higher ordinal already exists, the selector would move to a lower RC,
or the selector and release branch would not align to the same highest commit.

Forward movement is strictly monotonic by RC ordinal. A later defect is
repaired through a higher immutable RC, not by moving an old RC tag or rolling
the selector backward. The selector is therefore equivalent to
`v<version>-rc.latest`, while every concrete RC tag remains addressable.

## Selector And Consumer Adoption

The version-line selector answers only:

> Which highest-ordinal published immutable RC cut currently exists on this
> version line?

It never answers:

> Which exact STDO cut governs this consumer?

A Product Definition may retain `stdo://channels/<version>` as its discovery
selector, but its operative basis is the exact
`stdo://releases/v<version>-rc.<n>/` URI and installed-manifest digest. Moving
the Git version-line selector does not update any consumer. Adoption is a
separate explicit Product-Definition transition that resolves, presents,
installs, verifies, and pins the selected immutable RC. Resolution requires an
annotated selector with a distinct peeled commit; absence of a peeled selector
ref fails closed and cannot be interpreted as a lightweight selector whose tag
object is its commit.

Channel resolution enumerates the published RC tags for the selected Project
Release Namespace, including preserved unqualified historical cuts during a
namespace transition, selects the greatest positive ordinal, requires that cut
and the current selector to be annotated tags peeling to the same commit, and
fails closed when the selector lags or points elsewhere. Channel adoption also
refuses a same-line target whose ordinal is below the Product Definition's
current exact basis. A consumer that intentionally retains an older cut names
that immutable RC URI and digest explicitly and uses exact-basis operations
such as `sync`; it does not express that choice through the latest-version
channel.

Presentation and mutation are separate invocations. The read-only plan binds
the current Product Definition bytes and basis to the target immutable cut,
annotated tag object, peeled commit, tree, and installed-manifest digest, then
emits a deterministic plan digest. Mutation requires that exact digest as the
operator's acceptance and re-derives it before changing any Product Definition.
Selector, target, manifest, or definition drift invalidates the acceptance. A
fleet uses the same law with one aggregate digest over all exact per-definition
plans; planning inside a mutating invocation is not external presentation and
cannot authorize itself.

This split lets operators refer to `v<version>` for the latest published RC
without repeatedly incrementing the version line, while every governed project
retains reproducible exact-cut authority and changes only through explicit
adoption.

## Naming

The shared-source naming shape is:

- RC branch: `rc/<project>/<version>`;
- immutable RC tag: `<project>/v<version>-rc.<n>`;
- optional release branch: `release/<project>/<version>`; and
- mutable version-line selector tag: `<project>/v<version>`.

For example:

- candidate branch: `rc/stdo_representation/2.5.0`;
- first immutable cut: `stdo_representation/v2.5.0-rc.1`;
- second immutable cut: `stdo_representation/v2.5.0-rc.2`;
- latest-release branch: `release/stdo_representation/2.5.0`; and
- latest-published selector: `stdo_representation/v2.5.0`.

The unqualified profile remains lawful only under the single-project and
historical-conservation conditions above. Projects may choose another spelling
only in a release source whose ref policy proves collision freedom and preserves
the same project namespace, mutable carrier, immutable cut, and mutable selector
distinctions.

## Release-Scoped Assets

An immutable RC cut may carry release-scoped surfaces such as:

- release notes;
- release and installed-distribution manifests;
- dependency declarations;
- package or installed-carrier metadata;
- qualification receipts; and
- branch and tag identity declarations.

Before RC publication, each used surface is reconciled to the exact RC subject.
After publication, changing one of those bytes creates a different candidate
and therefore requires a higher RC tag. The version-line selector has no
content-reconciliation phase because it adds no new Product bytes.

Version-line branding does not belong in live present-tense Product or
requirements surfaces merely to signal recency. Exact version and RC identity
belong in release-scoped carriers and consumer basis bindings.

## Product Subject And Repository Carrier

Before qualification, the project declares:

- its Project Release Namespace and exact Project Subtree root;
- the exact Product member set or artifact constituting the release subject;
- the release-scoped claim surfaces describing that subject; and
- co-located mutable source-project fields excluded from both.

A repository commit carries those declared sets but does not make every
co-located file or sibling Project Subtree a Product member. The exact
Project Subtree tree and Product member inventory distinguish the subject from
the wider carrier. Once the immutable RC is published, no post-review carrier
delta is admitted into that cut. Publication-caused ticket or source-work
bookkeeping is recorded afterward on the continuing source branch and cannot
move the immutable RC tag.

## Acceptance Criteria

An RC may be accepted when:

- pre-RC qualification passed for the declared subject;
- independent exact-cut review passed where required;
- required operator review is complete;
- the intended release scope and successor relation are stable;
- release-scoped assets accurately describe the exact cut;
- all release-blocking gaps are closed or the claimed scope is explicitly
  narrowed; and
- the human Product authority accepted the exact immutable RC identity.

Acceptance attaches to that immutable RC identity. It neither advances nor
rolls back the version-line selector. Consumer adoption separately evaluates
the exact latest target presented by the channel and mutates only after its
digest-bound plan is accepted.

## External Qualification Dependencies

Some claims depend on external backends, transports, or operator-facing
services outside the local carrier. Such a dependency may remain out of Product
for carrier and migration classification while still blocking the dependent
release claim.

A clean skip caused by an unhealthy external dependency may preserve correct
Product classification, but it cannot establish that the dependent capability
passed. The claim is either qualified against a healthy dependency or narrowed
before acceptance.

## Successor Baseline Conservation (`STDO-UP-015`)

A successor identifies the exact predecessor immutable RC whose semantic claims
it evolves. That origin remains immutable for the candidate. Every predecessor
claim capable of affecting the successor receives one semantic disposition:

- **conserved** — the successor retains the claim;
- **superseded** — an accepted successor relation replaces it;
- **intentionally removed** — current Product authority removes it; or
- **not applicable** — it has no successor effect, with a bounded reason.

An unresolved disposition blocks qualification of the affected claim.
Conservation is semantic: patch absence does not prove loss when a
successor-native realization preserves behavior, and naming or code similarity
does not prove conservation without relevant evidence.

Where a maintenance or support line may affect retained claims, the release
basis identifies the watched source, observation boundary, inclusion policy,
and successor candidate. Relevant changes receive semantic disposition at
material integration and exact-cut qualification. The consumer owns its record,
branch strategy, comparison, and proof mechanism.

## Open Questions

- What exact qualification bundle is mandatory for each Product class?
- What version-line compatibility rule requires a new `<version>` rather than a
  higher RC ordinal?
