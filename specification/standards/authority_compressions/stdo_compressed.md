# STDO Compressed Authority

## Method Identity

`STDO` is shorthand for its four key method pillars:

- `S` — Specification (`SPEC_METHOD.md`);
- `T` — Ticketing (`TICKET_METHOD.md`);
- `D` — Design (`DESIGN_MODULE_METHOD.md`); and
- `O` — Outcome-Driven Development (`ODD_METHOD.md`).

`ODD` expands to Outcome-Driven Development. The `O` in `STDO` names that
complete ODD pillar.

This shorthand does not reduce the STDO Product to four files. Consumer
authority remains one complete immutable released STDO cut with its exact
member inventory.

## Governing Claim

Specification is constitutional source. Design and realization are subordinate
implementation surfaces. Code, prompts, tests, generated views, dashboards,
archives, and comments are projections or realization proof, not independent
truth.

Products, applications, modules, graph functions, build tenants, and runtime
surfaces implement constitutional documents; they do not replace them.

Method vocabulary names normative capabilities and construction relations.
Consumers bind concrete implementations and immutable identities under their
own Product authority. A downstream Product may prove or falsify conformance;
it cannot supply reusable method meaning. Constitutional examples use neutral
capability and authority identities.

This aggregate carries cross-source decisions that cannot be closed from one
source-specific compression, including the complete T-008 F1-F5 bundle and the
Reference Frame Method/STDO baseline application relation. Source-specific
compressions remain standalone only for decisions owned by their source and
refuse cross-law closure.

## Axiomatic Calculus

- `a_c` is the domain-specific, carrier-neutral constitutional calculus owned by
  `AXIOMATIC_CALCULUS.md` in
  `urn:stdo:bounded-context:axiomatic-calculus`.
- It makes no claim of universal applicability, logical completeness,
  consistency, decidability, soundness, or category-theoretic status except
  where separately proved for an exact scope.
- Keep `a_c`, an interpreted `a_c.X` model, and an encoded `a_c.X.C` carrier as
  distinct governed layers with separate content identities, judgments, and
  proof. Product status requires separate acceptance and release authority.
- One closed signature declares the fixed eight-member record-kind universe and
  every sort, relation kind, constraint kind, residual kind, functor kind,
  judgment kind, stop kind, field, value domain, and reference domain. The
  model tuple is `M_b = (b, I, O, E, C, L, X, V, T, J)`: exact basis,
  identities, objects, relations, constraints, latitude, residuals, traversals,
  transformations, and judgments.
  A total population map assigns every fundamental record to exactly one family.
  `RecordKind_ac` is exactly:

  ```text
  urn:stdo:concept:axiomatic-calculus:record-kind:semantic-object
  urn:stdo:concept:axiomatic-calculus:record-kind:typed-relation
  urn:stdo:concept:axiomatic-calculus:record-kind:constraint
  urn:stdo:concept:axiomatic-calculus:record-kind:latitude
  urn:stdo:concept:axiomatic-calculus:record-kind:residual
  urn:stdo:concept:axiomatic-calculus:record-kind:traversal
  urn:stdo:concept:axiomatic-calculus:record-kind:transformation
  urn:stdo:concept:axiomatic-calculus:record-kind:judgment
  ```
- Identity is scoped by type, context, owner, scope, and basis. The total
  `RefDomain_Sigma(record_kind, field)` function closes every identity-bearing
  field with exact cardinality, permitted local record families and sorts,
  external target kinds, and `required_basis_relation`. Relations
  are directed and typed. Authority, provenance, and residual uncertainty
  survive every projection, transformation, interpretation, and encoding.
- Transformation is an operation-bearing specialization of one exact
  traversal. It directly carries context, owner, scope, basis, operation
  authority, evidence, preservation, mutation, residual, and refusal
  coordinates plus one exact typed preservation relation; nominal preservation
  and broader or mismatched traversal coordinates refuse. Its local-record
  delta partitions every input local identity into preserved or removed and
  every successor local identity into preserved or introduced. Its separate
  `Resolution_M` delta partitions exact external-resolution coordinates into
  `external_preserved`, `external_removed`, and `external_introduced`, with one
  total equality witness for every preserved coordinate. Silent local or
  external retention, loss, duplication, reintroduction, or residual erasure
  refuses.
  Exact closure requires
  `Local_b = P_t disjoint_union R_t`,
  `Local_b_prime = P_t disjoint_union N_t`,
  `N_t intersect Local_b = empty`,
  `R_t intersect Local_b_prime = empty`,
  `E_b = EP_t disjoint_union ER_t`,
  `E_b_prime = EP_t disjoint_union EN_t`,
  `EN_t intersect E_b = empty`, and
  `ER_t intersect E_b_prime = empty`.
  `external_resolution_witnesses` contains exactly one
  `ExternalResolutionPreservationWitness` per preserved coordinate, with exact
  domain/codomain model and resolution tuples, `decision: equal`, and non-empty
  evidence; the tuples are field-equal. A cross-basis or cross-signature migration
  requires one separately identified specialization with exact composite-basis
  and compatible signature-extension relations; changed basis or record kind is
  removal plus introduction, never preservation.
- Material closure is the least finite unique lawful record closure under an
  exact dependency family. Projection returns that closure plus its explicit
  boundary; it cannot trim required members to meet a budget.
- `F_D`, `F_P`, and `F_H` are generic functor-kind identities. Apply them only
  as `F_K[v](X_v) -> Y_v | Omega_v`, with one exact traversal `v`. Actors and
  domain operations are separate coordinates.
- `F_D[v]` evaluates or proves declared properties and returns a judgment over
  an unchanged subject. `F_P[v]` performs bounded probabilistic interpretation,
  construction, or proposal without acceptance authority. `F_H[v]` performs
  explicit human adjudication under an exact grant.
- Equal spelling in another bounded context creates no import, specialization,
  or authority relation. Any external relation is separately owned and remains
  outside the calculus.
- Structural conformance proves closed shape, types, identities, references,
  and bases. It does not prove semantic fidelity or human acceptance.
- Model and carrier identities are content-first. Semantic acceptance and
  carrier admission are external judgments over unchanged subject identities;
  neither judgment enters the identity of its own subject.
- Carrier encoding requires an external accepted semantic judgment whose
  subject identity and digest exactly match the interpreted model. The judgment
  remains outside both content identities and is retained in the admitted
  encoding evidence relation.
- Concrete subject interpretations and carrier encodings remain downstream
  relations. Neither a selected interpretation nor a carrier is content of the
  calculus.
- `id(AxiomaticCalculusBasis)` is
  `urn:stdo:axiomatic-calculus-basis:sha256:` plus
  `sha256(JCS(AxiomaticCalculusBasis))`. Its exact kind is
  `stdo.axiomatic-calculus-basis`, schema version is `1`, and concept identity is
  the calculus. RFC 8785 JCS is mandatory and duplicate object names refuse. The
  record separates an absolute immutable accepted predecessor derivation basis
  from the distinct immutable successor publication basis. The predecessor
  manifest and every non-empty, duplicate-free, unsigned-UTF-16-sorted
  `principle_refs` member byte and heading fragment resolve exactly. The
  successor manifest, calculus `member_uri`, and `member_sha256` resolve exactly;
  same-carrier or cyclic derivation refuses.

## Traversal Occurrence Profile

- `TRAVERSAL_OCCURRENCE_PROFILE.md` owns one application-neutral `a_c`
  model-family profile. It instantiates one closed signature under an exact
  calculus basis without modifying the calculus; adoption remains optional and
  availability is not adoption.
- Only Traversal Occurrence Profile semantic objects use
  `SemanticObject.value`. Every relation, constraint, latitude, residual,
  traversal, transformation, and judgment retains its inherited `a_c` family
  and coordinates.
- The profile supplies a complete qualified
  `RefDomain_Sigma_occurrence(record_kind, field)` table and the exact inherited
  eight-family population. Relation and claim qualifiers use the declared
  nine-field contract; missing, unknown, duplicate, wrong-family, wrong-sort,
  or wrong-basis references refuse.
- `EventKind_occurrence` is closed to claim admission, occurrence admission,
  effect disposition, and external-fact admission, each with exact payload,
  scope, claim, and occurrence contracts.
- Occurrence identity binds only pre-admission application, traversal,
  functor-kind, subject-binding, intent, lineage, and identity-dependency
  inputs. Post-effect observations, evidence, judgments, events, ordinals, and
  projections cannot enter the seed.
- Candidate claim, claim judgment, framework event, event judgment, and
  materialized typed relation are distinct identities and authority surfaces.
  Their admitted semantic cut requires admitted claim, event, and cut judgments
  over unchanged subjects; exact `admits_claim`, `materializes_relation`, and
  successor `frontier_contains` edges; one basis; and identical source
  frontiers. It then contains its exact source and successor frontiers or
  refuses. Byte-equal duplicate admission reuses the cut; a collision refuses.
- Identity dependency, occurrence cause, and event cause are separate acyclic
  graphs. Wider typed lineage may contain opposing support and correction
  edges; temporal or carrier order does not create cause.
- Mutable reality remains external under one stable subject binding.
  Observation, result, evidence, checkpoint, event, projection, cache, or model
  content cannot replace it.
- Functor kind, traversal, effect operation, executor, actor, owner-issued
  grant, and invocation are distinct. Every effect-operation instance binds one
  operation kind, subject, territory, and contract. Its exact instance contract
  must equal the OperationKind contract, and the invocation and
  grant must reproduce the kind, subject, and territory coordinates. Reapplying
  the traversal over the then-current subject creates a fresh immutable
  occurrence.
- An effect-readiness judgment binds the current observation, invocation,
  operation, territory, and grant. Stale or unauthorized readiness never
  dispatches; later disposition is immutable and partial effect remains an
  explicit residual with bounded post-observation.
- Every retained component traversal application has its own occurrence. A
  declared composite application may also have an aggregate occurrence; typed
  component membership is not material cause.
- An event frontier binds the complete event set, exact basis, and precedence
  law. New events require a new frontier; a new projection judgment is required
  only when that frontier is projected or evaluated.
- A Product separately adopts and interprets the profile. The profile grants no
  operation, admission, evaluation, decision, correction, continuation, or
  closure authority and contains no consumer runtime mapping.

## Authority Flow

Use the smallest current authority surface that can decide the question:

`Goals -> Intent -> Product Definition -> Requirements -> Design -> Code -> Events -> Projection -> Delta -> Scenarios -> Gap Analysis -> Repricing`

When a lower layer needs a change in meaning, re-enter at the smallest upstream
layer that owns the missing truth.

## Product Definition Overlay

- Every STDO-defined product has one `stdo_<label>.json` definition per
  distinct current `WHAT`; `stdo_default.json` is the singleton default.
- `product.definition_id` identifies the mutable `WHAT` definition line, not
  any immutable Product or release produced from it. Product and release
  identities remain separate; a fork or independently governed definition
  receives another definition identity.
- The definition locates complete constitutional authorities and entrypoints,
  local axioms/overrides/disambiguations, collective reference-frame bases,
  Intent/Product/specification `WHAT`, common and tenant-local `HOW`,
  Goals/tickets/comments/optional sprints, and explicit product composition.
  It is a locator and relation authority, not a restatement of referenced
  truth.
- `constitution.stdo.source` and its `stdo://channels/<version>` selector are
  transport and mutable discovery inputs. The exact
  `stdo://releases/v<version>-rc.<n>/` URI and installed-manifest digest are the
  sole authored operative STDO selection. Additional constitutional sets and
  every reading entrypoint are basis-qualified.
- A constitutionally sufficient document set collectively makes axioms,
  ontology, epistemology, taxonomy, and semantics recoverable. These are
  coverage dimensions, not five assumed documents or directories.
- Each local disambiguation binds the exact term, target bounded context,
  complete material candidate set, one selected member of that set, owning
  carrier and authority, semantic bases, and governed scope. The overlay
  locates the resolution; it does not own or restate the candidate meanings.
- `reference_frame_bases` is non-empty and locates each durable shared project
  frame-basis declaration, its existing admitting authorities, and exact
  governed scope. A ticket or other authorized work instruction binds one
  agent's exact activation from an applicable basis. The Product Definition
  Overlay is neither an actor registry nor a store of temporary active
  configurations.
  A Product or runtime carrier named `Frame` remains `WHAT` or `HOW`; nominal
  overlap does not make it a collective evaluation frame.
- Existing projects bind their current carriers without restructuring. The
  default `specification/`, `build_tenants/`, and `.ai-workspace/` layout
  is scaffold only.
- One shared versioned store may carry many immutable cuts for many projects.
  Store paths and registry entries are derived; no project-local standards copy
  is required. Every managed store component is a physical directory or regular
  file; verification inventories all entry types and rejects redirection,
  special entries, and anything not derived from exact manifest paths. `sync`
  materializes only a definition's pinned cut. `adopt --dry-run` emits a digest
  binding current definition bytes to the exact cut, tag, commit, tree, and
  manifest; mutation requires and re-derives that accepted digest. Fleet
  adoption likewise requires its aggregate plan digest. Stable agent files only
  discover the definition, verify the exact installed basis, and route to its
  bootstrap entrypoint.
- Discover definitions recursively. Several definitions may share a monorepo
  root or appear at arbitrarily deep project roots. Folder nesting creates no
  implicit inheritance or composition; composition references other definition
  URIs explicitly. Each composition edge also binds the expected target
  definition identity, directed relation authority, and a non-empty governing
  contract set.
- Fleet discovery prunes the exact VCS, dependency, generated, cache, and
  managed-store names declared by `SPEC_METHOD.md` and refuses symlinked
  definitions. Bootstrap targets are relative to resolved
  `product.source_project`; parent traversal, redirection, and boundary escape
  fail closed. Fleet bootstrap confines source projects to its authorized root
  and preflights all targets. Exactly one ordered marker span is manager-owned;
  all prefix and suffix bytes remain project-owned and byte-identical.
- Portable Draft 2020-12 schema validation proves shape. URI formats remain
  annotations unless an assertion-capable validator is used, so conformance
  separately checks RFC 3986 syntax, resolution, target identity, immutable
  release identity, cross-file uniqueness, constitutional sufficiency,
  semantic-resolution completeness, and authority congruence. Every `stdo:`
  schema locator is parsed case-insensitively before loading and must select the
  same immutable cut as the operative basis.

## Bounded-Context Semantic Isolation

- Term spelling is a label, not context-free concept identity. Resolve each
  material occurrence by term, bounded-context identity, owning authority,
  selected basis, and governed scope.
- An owning document, section, field, operation, or other surface may declare
  context once. Unqualified use is lawful when exactly one concept resolves.
  Zero or multiple applicable concepts fail closed; repository position,
  nominal match, actor familiarity, frequency, or recency cannot choose one.
- `GLOSSARY_GUIDE.md` is a non-deciding locator index, not a global default
  namespace. Each row points to a source clause that declares the context and
  owns the concept; the index declares neither. Another context receives a
  meaning only through an explicit relation.
- Cross-context import, disambiguation, directional translation, or equivalence
  identifies exact source and target concepts and contexts, relation kind and
  direction where material, preserved and changed meaning, loss, refusal,
  owners, bases, scope, provenance, lifecycle, and invalidation. It transfers
  no semantic or decision authority.
- The world-model context imports `Source Project`, `Product`, `Install`, and
  `Artifact` unchanged from the recursive taxonomy. `Builder Project` is a
  distinct exact target concept related to `Source Project` by a directional
  specialization that declares preserved and narrowed meaning, loss, refusal,
  owners, basis, scope, and invalidation. Glossary references remain indexes.
- Conformance covers positive unique-resolution and explicit-relation cases and
  negative collisions for `Frame`, `Owner`, `Product`, `Tenant`, and `User`.
  Correct output through an inferred or guessed meaning does not pass.

## Build-Tenancy Compression

- Build tenancy is STDO's `WHAT` once, independent `HOW` one-or-many
  realization model. The bound `what` remains singleton constitutional truth;
  `how.build_tenants` locates one or more project-owned realizations beneath
  it.
- Each build tenant may carry tenant-local design, tooling, code, proof,
  release, and lifecycle state. No tenant becomes a second constitution, and
  one tenant's evidence cannot close another tenant's claim.
- `how.build_tenants` canonically records tenant identities and locations.
  `how.common` carries only realization law explicitly adopted across more
  than one tenant. A Markdown tenant registry is a companion or projection, not
  a second authority.
- Tenant-local truth remains local. Similarity creates a commonization
  candidate, not shared law; promotion to `common/` requires the applicable
  design re-entry and preserves semantic ownership.
- An upstream-only work item needs no tenant ticket, and a single-tenant item
  needs no sibling. When one admitted upstream item has multiple tenant
  execution lines, retain the upstream ticket and create one suffixed ticket
  per tenant with `source_ticket`, `build_tenant`, independent status, proof,
  closure, reopening, and repricing.
- Build tenancy is not a synonym for hosted, runtime, customer, account, or
  data multitenancy. A downstream Product claiming those forms owns their
  separate identity, isolation, lifecycle, and proof law.

## Prime Operating Rules

- Do not create a second truth surface when a current authority surface exists.
- Keep active constitutional surfaces present-tense.
- Treat generated artifacts and summaries as read models unless admitted as
  source truth by the owning method.
- Missing traceability is a defect.
- Prefer one algebraic primitive plus projections over multiple local decision
  systems.
- When `DESIGN_MODULE_METHOD` is adopted for a new or materially changed
  semantic boundary, treat discovered functionality as input to design, not as
  pre-authorized operation identities. Derive a candidate Ontology, complete
  lifecycle and authority, run whole-family Prime, and then accept the Ontology
  before promoting IACS, public operations, schemas, or modules.
- The Ontology is semantic-design authority, not a replacement for target
  architecture or module design. Domain, sequence, state, authority, IACS, and
  public-contract surfaces preserve it; code and tests derive through
  requirements plus accepted design.
- Naming an admitter is not sufficient. State the complete admission relation
  for each consequential entity-transition domain — entity identity,
  predecessor basis, authority scope, candidate family, decision cardinality,
  admission predicate, durable result, supersession law. Singularity attaches to
  the relation, not one actor; quorum, multi-signature, step-up, and proxy are
  lawful when declared. A projection may produce a candidate but confers no
  admission authority, and reconstructed state is not self-authenticating.
- Disposition every equivalent competing path explicitly as a constituent, a
  replica, a replacement, or a deliberately independent realization of the
  admission law. Disposition does not mean deletion; an undisposed equivalent
  path is the defect, not the equivalence itself.
- For a material transition, each admission owner independently derives the
  causally complete enclosing relation, including every relevant participant,
  equality join, and crossing seam, from one exact admission-valid basis.
  Basis continuity holds through admission: advancement after preflight causes
  a declared predecessor/currentness check or effect-free re-entry, and
  participating owners use an equal or design-declared coherent composite
  basis, never mixed independently valid bases. Every participant and join is
  validated before effect; the semantic commit is the complete transition,
  admitting all or none. Caller or owner assertions cannot establish this law.
- Direct and every supported composite or nested boundary preserve the same
  law; competing same-scope paths cannot bypass it, and fresh reconstruction or
  replay reproduces the exact relation, basis, and outcome or refusal. Qualify
  each owner and supported boundary for direct, supported composite/nested,
  forged, ambiguous enclosing relation, stale or preflight-advanced basis,
  incoherent multi-owner basis, competing same-scope authority,
  reconstructed/fresh-process, exact replay equality, and post-validation
  atomic failure. Exercise
  every materially distinct boundary capable of exposing a subset, unless a
  design-declared dominance/equivalence proof shows named observations cover
  the complete partial-failure surface, and follow each with fresh
  reconstruction. An indivisible unit is observed immediately on both sides;
  final-participant validation failure is not atomic-failure evidence.
- For each material admission relation, accepted design compactly declares the
  owner and supported boundary; exact basis and continuity, including any
  coherent multi-owner basis; enclosing relation, participants, and joins;
  refusal/effect boundary; complete semantic commit unit and decomposability;
  every materially distinct post-validation partial-failure boundary, or a
  design-declared dominance/equivalence proof that named observations cover the
  complete surface; reconstruction; supported direct/composite/nested forms;
  and competing paths. Qualification is per owner and supported boundary;
  unsupported composite/nested forms require design-grounded `not_applicable`
  and no weaker or competing path. Missing or downstream-invented fields,
  inferred basis/boundary-coverage/reconstruction law, or helper-manufactured
  non-applicability falsifies the declaration.
- Declare the governing frames a material boundary derives from, its bounded
  affected relation set, and the seams crossing it. Frames form a constraint
  network; more than one governing frame is lawful. Every seam crossing the
  affected set must either include its causally relevant far-side relation or
  state why that relation cannot affect and cannot be affected by the action.
  A bounded local action conserves governing truth; changing a governing
  relation re-enters there.
- Design evidence is durable reasoning state for a bounded actor. The selected
  STDO basis plus accepted design must recover every governing relation in a
  proposed action's causally closed affected set and decide preserve, change,
  duplicate, or violate — without dialogue, commentary, prior-worker memory, or
  folklore. Design must not restate federal decision law to achieve this.
- The four decisions: `preserve` leaves the relation intact and operates inside
  it; `change` alters the relation and re-enters at it before acceptance;
  `duplicate` establishes an equivalent path explicitly disposed as constituent,
  replica, replacement, or deliberately independent realization; `violate`
  contradicts the relation or leaves an equivalent path undisposed. The
  change/violate boundary is the locus of acceptance, not the size of the delta.
  The duplicate/violate boundary is disposition, not equivalence.
- Declare a role set for every material realization component; capability is not
  authority. At a material boundary also project the domain design into data
  structures, algorithms, algebraic laws, and effect boundaries. That projection
  is subordinate: similarity yields a commonization candidate, never an
  adjudication. Materially non-equivalent identity, ownership, ordering,
  mutation, consistency, retention, failure, access, lifecycle, or authority law
  requires separation; a difference alone does not discharge Prime contraction.
- Dispose every material algorithmic obligation twice. Semantically it is an
  existing accepted relation, an extension of one, or a new candidate relation.
  In realization it is consume, implement locally, optimize, adapt, or
  deliberately duplicate under stated non-semantic constraints — isolation,
  substrate, performance, security, or dependency ownership. The rule is not
  that equivalent code is never rebuilt; it is that a local realization must not
  present an accepted semantic or authoritative relation as newly owned local
  truth.
- Before constructing a material generic capability, common mechanic, or
  algorithm, or selecting a material dependency, apply DMM `STDO-UP-023`
  proportionally. State the capability without Product, domain, module, vendor,
  file, or incumbent labels. Distinguish every irreducible semantic or authority-
  bearing relation and its owner, role kind, subject, scope, basis, lifecycle,
  and refusal invariants from generic mechanics and foundation capabilities.
  Compare credible project, native/standard, predecessor-lineage, maintained
  external, local, and mixed compositions across material total-lifecycle
  dimensions. Bound discovery by recording searched sources or categories,
  cutoff and version basis, applicability criteria, exclusions, predecessor or
  incumbent status, discovered candidates, and residual unknowns. A material
  discovery gap prevents selection; a later materially qualifying candidate
  invalidates the affected selection evidence. The comparison
  operates inside the Product boundary and any applicable migration strategy
  already admitted by their existing owners and does not displace SPEC's
  bounded-evolution versus fundamental-re-adoption decision. Hard authority,
  contract, safety, security, license, or constructability failure eliminates a
  candidate; unknowns remain unknown.
  One lawful composition dominates another only when every material dimension
  is comparable or evidenced as non-discriminating, it is no worse on every
  comparable dimension, and strictly better on at least one. A material unknown
  that could reverse the relation prevents dominance. A dominated candidate,
  including a local generic rebuild, cannot be selected unless new evidence or
  another material dimension invalidates the dominance relation.
  Select from the undominated frontier only through priorities and risk
  tolerances declared by the existing tradeoff owner for the exact Product and
  basis; if they do not resolve it, retain the gap. Reuse does not automatically
  confer or transfer authority. A foundation may realize an explicitly assigned
  authority-bearing role only while preserving the declared relation's owner,
  role kind, subject, scope, basis, lifecycle, and refusal invariants. Ownership
  follows the declared relation, not local authorship. A newly exposed material
  generic subproblem recursively re-enters selection. This prior pass is
  distinct from recurrence review.
- Apply the gate proportionally. An unchanged `realization_refactor` cites the
  accepted Ontology/design basis and proves no semantic delta. Re-evaluate only
  affected relations and projections, with no extra ticket or approval ceremony.
- Where `DESIGN_MODULE_METHOD` is adopted, co-evolution is admissible only when
  the complete material-relation set has no unresolved member, is jointly
  satisfiable, and admits no materially non-equivalent network under the
  governing Product, requirements, and accepted design relations. Neither mode
  is the global default. Design still owns structural `HOW`; otherwise the
  smallest causally closed affected set requires a prior design gate. Outside
  an adopted boundary, retain the generic no-unresolved-material-design-decision
  test. Design/implementation feedback carries evidence and falsification,
  never reverse semantic authority.
- Treat Ontology, Prime, IACS, views, modules, implementation, and tests as
  projections of that one decision-complete network. Headings, artifact
  presence, exact identity, and aggregate green labels cannot supply a missing
  semantic relation.
- IACS is not numerically frozen. Addition, removal, merge, or split proceeds
  through accepted Ontology/design re-entry. Re-derive and classify the complete
  set, rerun Promotion and Boundary Inflation over the full revised set, update
  every existing conformance/checker subject to the declared composite carrier
  relation, and reconcile implementation before closure.
  No concrete checker is required to exist. Prohibition without a lawful path,
  new-carriers-only gates, weaker assurance, or unreconciled implementation
  falsifies revision.
- Prime atoms are irreducible semantic-design relations. Apply contraction to
  the complete candidate semantic-atom family and all realization projections.
  Each accepted atom records its admitted domain and governs every admitted
  instance in it; every proposed realization projection maps explicitly to its
  accepted atom or atoms. Later cases compose or parameterize the atom rather
  than creating feature-local replacements.
- Method compression is a prompt input, not a replacement for the source method.
- Select one complete immutable STDO version; mutable source and mixed standard
  sets are not consumer authority.
- Proof identifies its exact property and nearest weaker excluded property.
  Semantic basis, evidence basis, and state projection remain distinct.
- Assurance supporting promotion or closure binds the exact subject and its
  authoritative composition relation. Per-file evidence cannot close a
  multi-file or carrier-set claim; cross-carrier satisfaction and conflict are
  decided at the declared composite boundary.
- Mechanical enforcement names an executable or reproducible predicate and a
  witness reachable through the declared ordinary assurance path. Planned or
  specification-only evidence is not observed verification. Absent that
  predicate or declared-path witness, the claim stays open or narrows to the
  planned property. Quantifier, population, and scope cannot outrun evaluated
  evidence; generalization requires a declared inference relation, comparable
  population, counterexample treatment, and governing evidence. Later
  counterevidence invalidates dependent verdicts until superseded, withdrawn,
  or requalified.
- Generic method sufficiency consumes the Probabilistic Work Boundary,
  `STDO-UP-020`, and Reconstruction Litmus. A fresh competent constructor works
  inside a declared capability/context/configuration envelope using only the
  declared ordinary method and authority surfaces. An independently authorized
  evaluator has a declared governing basis and comparison predicate. Where
  exposure compromises independence, material expected/reference outcomes,
  source exemplars/incumbents, author memory, and ad hoc rescue are withheld from
  the constructor until its result is frozen. After freeze, the evaluator
  compares that result against the mandatory governing semantic basis. Any
  separately held material expected/reference outcome, if one exists and is
  applicable, is optional evidence and explicitly non-authoritative; equivalence
  to it is required only where the governing basis requires it. A lawful
  alternative permitted by the basis passes, while subjective similarity to the
  basis or reference is insufficient to establish semantic conformance/
  equivalence. Byte/structural identity, unique derivation, determinism, and
  incumbent equality are not generic criteria. An out-of-envelope actor cannot
  indict the method. Post-exposure revision is a declared intervention and either
  a method constituent with its qualification boundary or a new qualification
  subject; it cannot retroactively pass the frozen run. Undeclared constructor
  competence, context, or configuration, undeclared supplemental method or
  authority input, undeclared evaluator authority, basis, or predicate, premature
  reference exposure, omission of the governing basis, constructor-authorized or
  self-adjusted comparison, reference-as-authority, reference equivalence required
  where the basis does not require it or omitted where the basis does,
  subjective-similarity proof, generic identity criteria, and unclassified
  revision falsify qualification. No fixed actor type/count, review round,
  engine, prompt, or orchestration follows.
- Product progress advances one explicitly selected unresolved Product-defined
  outcome instance with a declared acceptance interval. Acceptance ends that
  instance's progress authority while retaining prior witnesses as regression
  evidence; selecting the next already-defined outcome still requires explicit
  Goals/work sequencing. Evidence cannot select, enlarge, or replace its
  Product claim.
- An ODD constructive loop consumes that selected Product outcome as external
  authority. Models, gaps, assurance, ledgers, projections, edge closure, and
  next-action machinery cannot author, select, enlarge, or accept the outcome.
  Repricing requests re-entry; it does not perform re-entry or choose a
  successor outcome.
- Target binding and admitted construction intent preserve exact selected
  outcome and bounded-basis refs for causal replay. An unresolved
  `post_reprice` returns typed no-action until lawful re-entry separately admits
  a new basis.
- Within a Product-outcome-bearing wave, material realization growth requires
  the selected outcome, an admitted named bounded prerequisite to it, or an
  admitted named bounded experiment whose stated observation discriminates a
  stated decision for it. Admission or renewal belongs to the work-wave owner
  or explicitly bounded proxy and is durably recorded in existing Goals or
  ticket authority. Each prerequisite or experiment declares its provisional
  bound and terminal condition and cannot enlarge Product, authorize downstream
  work, confer promotion or closure, or waive applicable law. Acceptance of the
  outcome, discharge of the prerequisite, resolution of the experiment
  decision, another admitted terminal condition, exhaustion, rejection,
  withdrawal, supersession, repricing of the basis away, or falsification ends
  that authority. Evidence, active work state, prior admission, repair, or
  continuation cannot renew it;
  retained evidence, regression protection, or donor material does not inherit
  growth authority.
- Judge proportionality by semantic ambiguity removed versus effective
  reasoning complexity added, not by line or artifact count. Rival authority,
  failure classification, and evidence uncertainty count only as types or
  evidence of materially distinct admissible interpretations removed.
  Downstream implementation paths, runtime states, tests, reviews, and
  reconciliation joins are counterfactual evidence of that contraction, not an
  independent numerator. Do not prescribe internal agent procedure when its
  variation has no governed effect, and do not create per-clause rationale
  carriers.
- For probabilistic or agentic construction, begin from a reconstruction-
  sufficient governing basis and execute the smallest coherent causal cone.
  Bind selected computational relations, construction and assessment authority,
  and re-entry conditions. Constructor self-review is not independent live-
  surface assessment.
- A bounded proxy may accept preservation, require local repair, reject a
  violation, and advance to the next already-authorized action. Product,
  requirement, governing-authority, or accepted-design changes re-enter at
  their owner. Routine advancement requires no renewed human ceremony when the
  delegation is already accepted.
- Disposition bounded candidates as `accept`, `local_repair`, `re_enter`, or
  `reject`. Conserve every governing relation affected by the local action;
  unrelated incompleteness is repricing input. Repeated failure against an
  unchanged boundary triggers reassessment without a numeric candidate or
  review-round threshold.
- Transition evidence binds the exact candidate, affected relations, changed
  and competing paths, proof, remaining seams, non-changes, and disposition.
  Use focused falsification during construction and whole-candidate proof at a
  declared boundary unless risk requires it earlier. A durable reconstruction
  claim needs loss or exclusion of incidental process state when same-process
  state is a material counterexample.
- Acceptance binds an exact checkpoint and permits the next already-authorized
  action without widening scope. Accepted material Product movement is
  progress; rejected or superseded work is churn; repeated proof is evidence;
  discovery of hidden distance revises forecast. No numeric progress algorithm
  is prescribed.
- When both strategies are lawful and feasible, bounded evolution is the
  rebuttable selection presumption when a working predecessor can reach the
  admitted outcome without competing or ambiguous authority. It never requires
  continuing an unsafe or inadmissible path. Fundamental re-adoption requires
  explicit human comparative selection and an abort or re-entry condition.
- Product-slice promotion requires singular authority across the full causal
  closure of its acceptance path but does not close an enclosing migration.
  Ticket and review wording cannot exclude causally applicable authority;
  competing authority, safety failures, retained-behavior regressions, and
  durable architectural decisions that foreclose an admitted Product outcome
  remain blocking. Other observations remain repricing input rather than
  automatic scope or ticket creation.
- Native constructability precedes design acceptance. Prime applies recursively
  and counts governance cost while conserving root authority.
- Apply an axiom family only where it is causally relevant to the selected
  outcome and affected published boundary. Cite unchanged accepted relations
  rather than reproving them; axioms do not authorize horizontal realization
  growth.
- Authority has identity and may be proxied only through an explicit bounded
  grant. Implementer self-review is not independent review.
- Exact-cut qualification declares the Product release subject, release-scoped
  claims, and excluded source state against one immutable annotated RC tag. At
  publication, the mutable annotated `v<version>` selector advances
  monotonically to the highest-ordinal published RC; a lightweight, lagging, or
  backward selector is invalid. It is discovery, never exact authority.
  Consumer channel adoption refuses a same-line downgrade and is a separate
  two-invocation transition whose mutation requires the externally accepted
  exact plan digest. An intentionally older cut remains available through its
  exact immutable basis. Any qualifying-byte change requires a higher immutable
  RC; selector advancement adds no second final carrier or semantic review.
- Agentic development conforms by following the constitutional process from
  declared authority, with produced artifacts passing deterministic admission. A
  walkthrough a competent agent using declared authority cannot complete is a
  method defect; agent error is not.
- Operational lifecycle signal is constitutional pressure. Product and
  requirements provide enough signal for downstream design, or name the gap.
  The canonical chain is: intent -> requirement -> build -> assurance ->
  release -> deployment -> live usage -> observed telemetry -> retirement.
- Design-module review confirms lifecycle signal at the realization boundary.
  Each phase is answered, declared not applicable with a reason, or recorded as
  `Gap:` / `Unanswered:`. Implementation precedent, prompt prose, local
  convention, and test fixtures cannot invent missing lifecycle authority.

## Reference Frame Engagement Compression

- Keep three owners distinct: `REFERENCE_FRAME_METHOD.md` supplies pure frame
  principles; `STDO_REFERENCE_FRAME_BASELINE.md` supplies an optional role and
  evaluation profile; each Product owns its concrete Project Reference-Frame
  Basis under `SPEC_METHOD.md`. Profile availability, Product adoption, and
  execution-scoped activation are distinct.
- A reference frame is one finite, capability-bounded evaluation context. It
  binds evaluation family, exact subject/basis, material relations, coordinates,
  invariants, semantic/evaluation/decision authority and operation authority
  where material, evidence, exclusions, closed results, invalidation, actor
  capability, and only the cross-frame relations actually used.
  Operationally it is an evaluation contract defining finite attention scope.
  A prompt, context packet, symbolic program, or other representation projects
  an activation; it does not become the frame or create its authority. The pure
  method supplies a complete prose activation binding and worked Product-chain
  drift example, so no representation Product is required.
- The optional baseline supplies twelve generic specialist-frame families:
  Product, Product Composition, Design, Design Component, Public Boundary,
  Entity, Operator, Owner, Effect, Reuse/Foundation, Install, and Proof. For the
  exact outcome, each family is instantiated where material, evidenced as
  non-material by capable authority, or retained as an explicit residual.
  These are evaluation families, not required actors, stages, components,
  files, services, runtime types, or new semantic owners. Product Composition
  evaluates directed Product roles and governing contracts; executable
  Integration remains a distinct Product-testing frame.
- Generic-frame coverage records the union of admissible observations, while a
  composite claim is satisfied only through a declared conjunction satisfying
  every applicable constraint. Material seams preserve or lawfully translate
  identity, coordinate/basis, value/evidence, lifecycle, authority, and
  provenance. Missing or non-commuting seams return closed pressure rather than
  selecting a dominant frame.
- The pure method imports no consumer profile, role mapping, Product binding,
  runtime topology, adoption relation, or discovery provenance. Applications
  may declare external profiles and bindings under their own authority;
  same-spelled carriers are not enrolled by label.
- Frame disjointness, separately activated evaluation, and claim-relative
  assurance independence are distinct. Frames may overlap, refine, restrict,
  translate, compose, or succeed one another. Hierarchy is optional. Shared
  entities or equal-looking values do not collapse coordinates, meaning,
  evidence, or authority.
- A state-value change preserves topology only when every material entity,
  relation, lifecycle, authority, capability, adjacency, and seam is preserved;
  otherwise the activation requires topology recharting.
- The baseline result family is `satisfied`, `falsified`, `indeterminate`,
  `out_of_frame`, or `invalid_basis`. Missing context, evidence, authority, or
  capability cannot be converted to satisfaction.
- Coverage is relative to an exact workspace, governed outcome, basis, known
  evaluation inventory, frame set, and time. It covers material interactions,
  semantic/operation/decision authority, failure, capability, separately
  activated overlap, assurance independence, or explicit residuals; file,
  artifact, test, review, or actor count is not coverage.
- Existing Goals, Product, requirements, or accepted-design authority owns the
  Project Reference-Frame Basis: method/profile basis, frames, actor-binding
  rules, capability/grant requirements, scopes, result and coverage relations,
  lifecycle triggers, and invalidation. The Product Definition only locates
  that binding.
- The practical STDO profile maps Executive, Worker, and Reviewer frames onto
  existing law: Executive uses existing project or bounded-proxy decision
  authority; Worker is the `STDO-UP-020` constructor; Reviewer supplies the
  independent live-surface evaluation governed by `STDO-UP-007` and
  `STDO-UP-022` where `STDO-UP-020` requires it. The profile creates no peer
  execution, review, disposition, checkpoint, or continuation law.
- Executive owns attention management, evaluation orchestration, and
  authorized-action selection inside its existing grant. It maintains the
  exact outcome/basis, Product-role map, evaluation inventory, smallest finite
  dependency-ready frontier, closed-result ledger, and residual boundary. It
  activates independent evaluations, consumes only closed results or declared
  translations, applies declared conjunctions, and selects only the next
  already-authorized action. It does not load every frame or inherit their
  undocumented working contexts.
- Product-chain drift locks keep Source Project, Product Definition, candidate
  checkpoint, Release Cut, Product, Install, Artifact, dependent Product, and
  directed composition-edge identities and authorities distinct. A
  Development Product is a role binding over one exact Install of a released
  Product acting as builder substrate, not a new Product identity or a source
  of meaning for the Product being authored. Exact review checkpoints and
  Products remain immutable under their lifecycle law; that immutability does
  not make the mutable Source Project immutable. Changed outcome, basis,
  Product role, authority, coverage, or return topology refuses, invalidates,
  or re-enters rather than enlarging the Executive frame.
- The complete baseline route is: Executive attempts Worker activation; an
  activation refusal returns directly to Executive and creates no Worker result;
  after lawful activation, `satisfied`, `falsified`, `indeterminate`, and
  `out_of_frame | invalid_basis` map exclusively to `candidate_ready`,
  `refused`, `incomplete`, and `re_entry_requested`. Every Worker result returns
  to Executive. For a candidate, Executive either dispositions directly when
  independent review is not required or activates Reviewer, receives the closed
  review result, and then applies exactly one existing `STDO-UP-020`
  disposition.
- Worker supplies an exact candidate but never activates Reviewer. The Worker
  label grants no mutation authority. An effectful Worker may mutate only the
  exact subject and write territory named by its inherited owner grant;
  missing, ambiguous, or out-of-territory authority refuses. Self-review is not
  independent review. Reviewer returns only a Reference Frame Method result and
  does not edit, direct repair, apply an STDO disposition, or authorize
  continuation. Executive cannot exceed its existing grant or become another
  semantic, operation, or implementation owner.
- The minimum activation packet carries frame identity/revision, evaluation and
  result algebra, exact subject/basis, material specialist frames and
  invariants, semantic/evaluation/decision authority and operation authority
  where material, actor capability, separate-activation and assurance-
  independence conditions, admissible evidence and acquisition path,
  exclusions, input and output relations, and invalidation/stop/re-entry
  conditions.
- Method qualification covers declaration, activation, every evaluation result,
  conjunction conflict and basis mismatch, translation preservation/loss/
  refusal, interaction and semantic/operation/decision-authority coverage,
  topology/capability/evidence revision, result consumption, material
  composition, activation refusal, and the closed Worker-result mapping. One
  valid frame set or coverage result cannot prove the unevaluated function
  population.

## Product Testing Frame Compression

- When a project adopts the optional STDO baseline for Product assurance,
  assign claims by fan-out rather than hierarchy: user outcome to UAT, runnable
  causal path to E2E, composition boundary to integration, and module-owned law
  to unit; then bind the distinct results through a declared conjunction to
  Product or release disposition.
- UAT and E2E evaluate an exact deployed, installed, or otherwise runnable
  Product form. UAT proves only that the declared user can obtain the claimed
  outcome through supported ordinary surfaces. E2E proves the complete
  authoritative causal path. Correct output through a forbidden path falsifies
  E2E, and harnessed substitutes cannot prove a boundary claimed as live.
- Integration proves one declared participant composition and interaction
  population. A substitute proves only its explicitly narrower equivalence
  claim.
- Every coded module retains its DMM-owned module-derived unit lane. Unit
  evidence proves module-owned laws, including public module contracts;
  internal combinatorial complexity determines evidence volume and strategy,
  not eligibility. Unit evidence cannot close Product, runnable-path,
  composition, user, or release claims.
- Coverage retains the exact claim, subject, path, population, oracle,
  interaction strength, residual combinations, and invalidation conditions.
  Test count, assertion count, source coverage, and aggregate green are not
  broader assurance.
- Technical-debt erasure evaluates two finite graphs. Production closure
  excludes obsolete, bypass, fallback, and rival paths from the exact runnable
  Product and configuration. Assurance/source closure prevents obsolete
  consumers, fixtures, proof scripts, generators, mutations, or tools from
  falsely supplying evidence or reintroducing the removed Product path. A
  declared test-only seam is lawful when isolated from Product distribution and
  ordinary-path evidence.
- Assurance subject acquisition and evaluation remain distinct. Acquire
  Product, runtime, lifecycle, admission, replay, and projection truth through
  the exact runnable owner surface. Then evaluate it with an independently
  law-derived oracle. Generic assurance may compare bytes, digests, order,
  equality, membership, completeness, and conjunction over owner-issued
  evidence; it may not reconstruct a rival owner state from raw payloads,
  events, logs, labels, or implementation fragments. A missing owner projection
  is a gap, not permission for proof code to become another semantic owner.
- Return a counterexample to its causally minimal supported frontier, not merely
  the first logged failure. Represent one unique locus, a jointly established
  incomparable set, unresolved alternative frontiers, or `indeterminate`
  evidence. Localization does not authorize wider testing, compatibility repair,
  another controller, or reinterpretation of unchanged upstream law.

## Prompt-Relevant Rules

- A prompt is rendered contract code over typed authority. It is not source law.
- Prompt text must project current authority refs, obligations, contracts,
  boundaries, proof expectations, and fallback conditions.
- Prompt bodies must not carry historical workaround prose unless the current
  requirement, design, runtime, or test still needs that constraint.
- Raw method documents are fallback inputs when this compressed authority is
  stale, missing, or insufficient for a named unresolved method question.

## Re-Entry Compression

- `goal_reprice`: current work-wave focus changes.
- `intent_reprice`: direction or scope changes.
- `product_reprice`: product shape changes while intent stays stable.
- `requirement_reprice`: constitutional requirement truth changes.
- `design_reframe`: realization structure changes while requirements stay stable.
- `realization_refactor`: local realization changes with no upstream change.

## Proof Compression

Closure requires authority trace, realization proof, negative proof where drift
is plausible, and a present-tense statement of residual open pressure.
