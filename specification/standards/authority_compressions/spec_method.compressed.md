# SPEC_METHOD Compressed Authority

## Governing Claim

Specification defines product truth. Downstream surfaces implement, prove, or
project that truth; they do not replace it.

## Prompt-Relevant Rules

- Start with the highest live authority surface needed for the question.
- Do not use README, bootstrap, comments, tickets, or run history as product
  truth when Product, requirements, or design already decide the matter.
- If a prompt needs upstream ambiguity, name the unresolved authority gap before
  reading fallback context.
- Active specification should stay present-tense; historical comparisons belong
  in comments, design history, tickets, or release notes.
- Missing requirement, design, proof, or traceability is pressure, not success.

## Compression Use

Use this asset to orient a worker to source precedence, lawful re-entry, and
traceability. Do not use it to decide product-specific behavior; product
behavior must come from the current product authority packet.
