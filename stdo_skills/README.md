# STDO Skills

Current delivery: the [3.0.5 contract](specification/RELEASE_3_0_5.md) selects released 3.0.4 as builder and all five Products in one 3.0.5 cohort. Earlier basis/qualification statements below retain their historical scope unless explicitly carried forward by current evidence.

Both tenants now include a nominated-project representation workflow. Ask:
“Build an a_c representation of `/path/to/my-project`.” Explicit entries are
Codex `$stdo-work` and Claude `/stdo-tool-operations`. The current session authors
the supplied source; the a_c provider produces the model, recoverable carrier,
coverage and offline constraint explorer. Provider selection and installation
are explained in each tenant's guide below. This workflow does not need the
other coding host for authoring and does not claim Lean ran unless selected.

Two independently designed skill tenants apply the same shared STDO requirements:

| Tenant | Entry | Installation and verification |
|---|---|---|
| Codex | One progressive [`stdo-work`](build_tenants/codex/skills/stdo-work/SKILL.md) skill | [Codex package guide](build_tenants/codex/README.md) |
| Claude | Five cooperating skills, starting at [`stdo-workspace-change`](build_tenants/claude/skills/stdo-workspace-change/SKILL.md) | [Claude bundle installation](build_tenants/claude/INSTALL.md) |

Both initial dogfood packages are built and have actual-host task evidence.
Codex's finite nested handoff is independently supported. Claude's mandatory
handoff qualification on its declared CLI path remains open, so this is not a
fully qualified or accepted delivery. The [delivery report](.ai-workspace/work/T001/DELIVERY.md)
shows the supported outcomes, retained failures and next needed qualification.

The static methodology is the proper published immutable **STDO 3.0.1 RC1**
release, selected in [stdo_skills.json](stdo_skills.json), manifest
`60356364a412dbde8cffe68fe0eda4e2749b0162acce93495534eee13b223df8`.
The discovery selector does not change that operative basis.

```sh
stdo status --definition stdo_skills.json --verify
```

Construction used current tools: the STDO manager verified the installed basis;
[a_c's native 3.0.1 binding](../a_c/build_tenants/graphify/design/fd-support-stdo-3.0.1.md)
provided exact acquisition, observations, contexts, preflight, dispatch, scoped
writes and return/evidence operations. Native `results.conjoin` remains explicitly
unsupported. The two tenants consume the same contracts with different host designs.

Read [Product](specification/PRODUCT.md), [requirements](specification/requirements/README.md)
and the [representation delivery](.ai-workspace/work/T003_PROJECT_REPRESENTATION/DELIVERY.md)
for current use and evidence. The [initial delivery](.ai-workspace/tickets/active/T-001-skills-dogfood.md)
retains its separate earlier scope.
Use the package guides for a deliberately selected workspace-local installation.
This Product's delivery, acceptance and release are separate from the already
released methodology; no global skill deployment or efficiency claim is made.
